Sec.2.Legislative findings; intent
The legislature finds that in a 2015 opinion, the Arizona Court
of Appeals held in Cemex Construction Materials South, LLC v. Falcone
Brothers & Associates, Inc., 237 Ariz. 236 (Ct. App. 2015) that a
written preliminary twentyday notice that subsubcontractors and
suppliers to subcontractors are required to give as a precondition to
recovering against statutory payment bonds pursuant to section 34223,
Arizona Revised Statutes, must be sent by certified mail. The legislature
also finds that the construction industry believes the Cemex decision
incorrectly applied the legislature's intent in interpreting this notice
requirement. It is the intent of the legislature to clarify that under
section 34223, Arizona Revised Statutes, as amended by this act, the
written preliminary twentyday notice may be sent by first class mail
with certificate of mailing, certified or registered mail.
