A CONCURRENT RESOLUTION

Supporting
efforts to remember fallen veterans on the 21st day of each month.


(TEXT OF BILL BEGINS ON NEXT PAGE)





Whereas, some 1.4 million American veterans have given their
lives in the various wars in the defense of freedom; and
Whereas, this nation should honor the service and sacrifice of
these heroes in perpetuity, including the 21st century; and
Whereas, the highest honor our nation bestows on our military
and public officials, including the President of the United States, is formally
known as the "21 Gun Salute"; and
Whereas, Americans who have given their lives in defense of the
nation should be honored in a manner commensurate in dignity with the 21 Gun
Salute; and
Whereas, to accomplish this, on the 21st day of each month, the
people of Arizona could fly the United States flag at half staff and pause for
a 21second moment of silence at high noon in remembrance and honor of
all those who have selflessly given their lives in military service and in war,
thereby using only 252 of 31,536,000 seconds in a calendar year to meaningfully
honor these heroic American veterans; and
Whereas, governmental bodies and private institutions, in
adopting this policy, would help this generation and future generations to
understand and respect the sacrifice made by veterans who have given their
lives in defense of freedom.
Therefore
Be it resolved by the Senate of the State of Arizona, the House
of Representatives concurring:
That the Members of
the Legislature support efforts by the people of Arizona to fly the United
States flag at half staff and pause for a 21-second moment of silence at high
noon on the 21st day of each month in remembrance and honor of all those who
have given their lives in military service and in war.
