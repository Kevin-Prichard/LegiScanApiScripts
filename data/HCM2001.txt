A CONCURRENT MEMORIAL

urging the United
States Congress to enact legislation to repeal the tax on health insurance.


(TEXT OF BILL BEGINS ON NEXT PAGE)





To the Congress of the United States of America:
Your memorialist respectfully represents:
Whereas, sections 9010 and 10905 of the Patient Protection and
Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-148) and section 1406 of the Health Care and
Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-152) impose an unprecedented new
tax on health insurance that numerous policy experts agree will be passed on to
individuals, working families, small employers and seniors, contradicting a
primary goal of health reform by making care more expensive; and
Whereas, the health insurance tax will cause premiums on the
individual market to rise an average of $2,150 for individuals and $5,080 for
families nationally over a ten-year period, will increase premiums in Arizona
by an average of $1,964 over ten years and will increase premiums for families
in Arizona over $3,958 over ten years; and
Whereas, the health insurance tax will impact small employers
over the next ten years by reducing future private sector jobs by 125,000, with
59% of these reductions affecting small businesses, and reducing potential
sales by at least $18 billion, with 50% affecting small businesses; and
Whereas, the health insurance tax will increase premiums for
small employers in Arizona by an average of $2,674 per employee over ten years
and for large employers by an average of $2,645 per employee over ten years;
and
Whereas, the health insurance tax will impact Medicare
Advantage beneficiaries in Arizona by costing an average of $3,303 more in
premiums and reduced benefits over ten years; and
Whereas, the health insurance tax will impact Medicaid
beneficiaries in Arizona who are enrolled in a coordinated care program by
costing an average of $1,337 over ten years, putting pressure on already
strained state budgets, decreasing benefits and potentially creating coverage
disruption; and
Whereas, higher premiums are a disincentive for everyone to
obtain insurance coverage, particularly younger, healthier people who are
likely to drop their policy if it becomes too expensive, which would further
erode the risk pool and make coverage even less affordable.
Wherefore your memorialist, the House of Representatives of the
State of Arizona, the Senate concurring, prays:
1.That the United States Congress enact legislation
to repeal the health insurance tax, sections 9010 and 10905 of the Patient
Protection and Affordable Care Act and section 1406 of the Health Care and
Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, to make health care more affordable for
working families, individuals and businesses.
2.That the Secretary of State of the State of
Arizona transmit copies of this Memorial to the President of the United States,
the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, the President of the
United States Senate and each Member of Congress from the State of Arizona.
