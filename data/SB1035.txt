(h)(g)Those sheets on which the

section 19118 and the circulator is not properly registered at the time

2.After completing the steps in paragraph 1 of this
subsection, review each sheet to determine the county of the majority of the
signers and shall:
(a)Place a three or four letter abbreviation
designating that county in the upper righthand corner of the face of the
petition.
(b)Remove all signatures of those not in the county
of the majority on each sheet by marking an "SS" in red ink in the
margin to the right of the signature line.
(c)Cause all signature sheets to be grouped
together by county of registration of the majority of those signing and attach
them to one or more copies of the title and text of the measure.If
the sheets are too bulky for convenient grouping by the secretary of state in
one volume by county, they may be bound in two or more volumes with those in
each volume attached to a single printed copy of the measure.The
remaining detached copies of the title and text of the measure shall be
delivered to the applicant.
3.After completing the steps in paragraph 2 of this
subsection, remove the following signatures that are not eligible for
verification by marking an "SS" in red ink in the margin to the right
of the signature line:
(a)If the signature of the qualified elector is
missing.

4.After the removal of petition sheets and
signatures, count the number of signatures for verification on the remaining
petition sheets and note that number in the upper righthand corner of
the face of each petition sheet immediately above the county designation.
5.Number the remaining petition sheets that were
not previously removed and that contain signatures eligible for verification in
consecutive order on the front side of each petition sheet in the upper lefthand
corner.
6.Count all remaining petition sheets and
signatures not previously removed and issue a receipt to the applicant of this
total number eligible for verification.
B.If the total number of signatures for
verification as determined pursuant to subsection A, paragraph 6 of this
section equals or exceeds the constitutional minimum, the secretary of state,
during the same twenty day period provided in subsection A of this section,
shall select, at random, five percent of the total signatures eligible for
verification by the county recorders of the counties in which the persons
signing the petition claim to be qualified electors.The random
sample of signatures to be verified shall be drawn in such a manner that every
signature eligible for verification has an equal chance of being included in
the sample.The random sample produced shall identify each signature
selected by petition page and line number.The signatures selected
shall be marked according to the following procedure:
1.Using red ink, mark the selected signature by
circling the line number and drawing a line from the base of the circle
extending into the left margin.
2.If a signature line selected for the random
sample is found to be blank or was removed from the verification process
pursuant to subsection A of this section and is marked with an "SS",
then the next line down, even if that requires going to the next petition sheet
in sequence, on which an eligible signature appears shall be selected as a
substitute if that line has not already been selected for the random sample.If
the next eligible line is already being used in the random sample, the
secretary of state shall proceed back up the page from the signature line
originally selected for the random sample to the next previous signature line
eligible for verification. If that line is already being used in the random
sample, the secretary of state shall continue moving down the page or to the
next page from the line originally selected for the random sample and shall
select the next eligible signature as its substitute for the random
sample.The secretary of state shall use this process of alternately
moving forward and backward until a signature eligible for verification and not
already included in the random sample can be selected and substituted.
C.After the selection of the random sample and the
marking of the signatures selected on the original petition sheets pursuant to
subsection B of this section, the secretary of state shall reproduce a
facsimile of the front of each signature sheet on which a signature included in
the random sample appears.The secretary of state shall clearly
identify those signatures marked for verification by color highlighting or
other similar method and shall transmit by personal delivery or certified mail
to each county recorder a facsimile sheet of each signature sheet on which a
signature appears of any individual who claims to be a qualified elector of
that county and whose signature was selected for verification as part of the
random sample.
D.The secretary of state shall presume that the
date noted on the petition for a petitioner's signature is the date on which
the petitioner signed the petition, and any person seeking to establish a
different date for the signature bears the burden of proof in overcoming the
presumption.
E.The secretary of state shall retain in custody
all signature sheets removed pursuant to this section except as otherwise
prescribed in this title. END_STATUTE

START_STATUTE19-122.Refusal of secretary of state to file petition or transmit

venue
A.If the secretary of state refuses to accept and

the secretary of state shall provide the person who submitted the petition,
proposal, signature sheet or affidavit

address given on the date of signing the petition.If the address of
the signer given on the date of signing the petition is different from that on
the most current version of the general county register, the county recorder
shall examine the version of the general county register that was current on
the date the signer signed the petition to determine the validity of the
signature and to determine whether the person was eligible to sign the petition
at the time of signing. This subsection does not preclude introducing into
evidence a certified copy of the affidavit of registration of any signer dated
before the signing of the petition if the affidavit is in the possession of the
county recorder but has not yet been filed in the general county register.
C.An action that contests the validity of an
initiative or referendum measure based on the actions of the secretary of state
may not be maintained in any court in this state except as prescribed by this
section. A person may not maintain a separate action seeking to enjoin the
secretary of state or other officer from certifying or printing the official
