which is the provision of psychological services using telecommunication
technologies, by psychologists across state boundaries in the performance of
their psychological practice as assigned by an appropriate authority; and
Whereas, this compact
is intended to regulate the temporary in-person, face-to-face practice of
psychology by psychologists across state boundaries for thirty days within a
calendar year in the performance of their psychological practice as assigned by

legal recognition, in a manner consistent with the terms of the compact, to
psychologists licensed in another state;
Whereas, this compact
recognizes that states have a vested interest in protecting the public's health
and safety through their licensing and regulation of psychologists and that

states; and
