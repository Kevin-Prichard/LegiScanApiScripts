Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Arizona:
Section1.Title 15, chapter 12, article 3,
Arizona Revised Statutes, is amended by adding sections 15-1454 and 15-1455, to
read:
START_STATUTE15-1454.Community college research or development purposes;
product or services development; corporations; financial aid; agreements
A.A
community college district governing board by resolution may organize one or
more corporations under title 10 to stimulate the flow of capital into the
development of specific products or services that have advanced beyond the
theoretical stage and are capable of being reduced to practice on a commercial
scale. At least onehalf of any voting shares of such a corporation
shall be held by the district board, or a majority of the directors, trustees
or members of the corporation shall be designated or appointed by the district
board. A member or employee of the district board may not receive any direct
or indirect compensation, other than reimbursement for actual expenses incurred
in the performance of duties as a member, director or trustee of a corporation
organized under this section.
B.A
corporation may not be organized unless the district board finds in its
organizational resolution that the formation of such a corporation will
stimulate and encourage the development of new products or services in this
state in situations in which financial aid would not otherwise be reasonably
available from conventional lending sources. In addition to the powers a
corporation may have, each corporation may:
1.Enter
into product development agreements with persons doing business in this state,
on such terms and conditions as are consistent with the research or development
purposes of the district board, to advance financial aid to those persons for
the development of specific products or services, procedures and techniques to
be developed and produced in this state and condition those agreements on
contractual assurances that the benefits of increasing or maintaining
employment and tax revenues remain in this state and accrue to it.
2.Acquire,
lease, purchase, manage, hold and dispose of real and personal property in this
state and lease, convey or deal in or enter into contracts with respect to that
property on any terms necessary or incidental to carrying out research or
development purposes.
3.Hold
patents, copyrights, trademarks or any other evidences of protection or
exclusivity as to any products issued under the laws of the United States or
any state or nation.
C.Before
organizing a corporation under this section, the district board shall develop a
procedure for applications for financial aid to be forwarded, together with an
application fee prescribed by the district board, to the district board. The
district board shall investigate and prepare a report concerning the
advisability of approving the proposed financial aid for the applicant and
concerning any other factors deemed relevant. The investigation and report
shall include such facts about the applicant as the applicant's history, wage
standards, job opportunities, stability of employment, past and present
financial condition and structure, pro forma income statements, present and
future markets and prospects and integrity of management as well as the
feasibility of the proposed project to be granted financial aid, including the
state of development of the product or service as well as the likelihood of its
commercial feasibility. After consideration of the report and after any other
action as is deemed appropriate, the district board shall approve or deny the
application and shall promptly notify the applicant of its decision. Approval
shall be conditioned on the applicant's payment to the district board, within a
reasonable time after notification of approval as the district board may
specify, of a commitment fee prescribed by the district board.
D.The
district board may receive and accept aid or contributions of monies from any
source, including gifts or grants from private sources or from any department
or agency of the United States or this state, for the purposes of carrying out
this section.
E.The
district board may enter into research and development agreements, royalty
agreements, development agreements, licensing agreements and profit-sharing
agreements concerning the research, development, production, storing or
marketing of new products or services.
F.Expenditures
pursuant to this section may not be included as local revenues under the
expenditure limitations established pursuant to article IX, section 21,
Constitution of Arizona. END_STATUTE
START_STATUTE15-1455.Transfer of technology developed by community colleges;
intellectual property; policies; officer or employee interest in private entity
A.A
community college district governing board shall maintain intellectual property
policies that allow, on a case-by-case negotiated basis, the licensing,
assignment or other transfer of intellectual property owned by the district
board to third parties if the transfer is in the best interest of this state
and the community college system or otherwise promotes the dissemination of
community college research and development for the public benefit.
B.Notwithstanding
title 38, chapter 3, article 8, the community college district governing board,
a community college or an entity authorized to manage intellectual property on
behalf of the district board or a community college may enter into agreements
to transfer intellectual property owned by the district board to an officer or
employee of an institution under the jurisdiction of the district board or to
an entity in which an officer or employee maintains a substantial interest as
defined by section 38-502.
C.Before
concluding an agreement for the transfer of any intellectual property owned by
the district board to an officer or employee of the district board or a
community college or to an entity in which an officer or employee of the
district board or a community college maintains a substantial interest, the
district board or community college shall do all of the following:
1.Identify,
on a case-by-case basis, individual and institutional conflicts of interest and
conflicts of commitment that may arise as a result of the proposed transfer.
2.Determine
whether the potential conflicts are manageable.
3.If the
potential conflicts are manageable, develop a conflict management plan and
enter into agreements as necessary for the appropriate management and oversight
of the potential conflicts in conformance with policies of the district board
and the community college.
D.The
district board shall maintain appropriate policies and procedures for the
implementation of this section.
E.Expenditures
pursuant to this section may not be included as local revenues under the
expenditure limitations established pursuant to article IX, section 21,
Constitution of Arizona. END_STATUTE
