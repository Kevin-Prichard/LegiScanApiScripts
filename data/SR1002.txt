A RESOLUTION

honoring the phoenix thunderbirds and Thunderbirds Charities
for exceptional community service.


(TEXT OF BILL BEGINS ON NEXT PAGE)





Whereas, the Phoenix Thunderbirds were established in 1937 with
the purpose of assisting the Phoenix Chamber of Commerce in fulfilling its new
role as a convention and tourism bureau by serving as a special events
committee to venture into new fields; and
Whereas, the Phoenix Thunderbirds were originally established
as a committee of five young executives; and
Whereas, on the Phoenix Chamber of Commerce's suggestion that
the committee become an official group and expand its membership, each of the
five original members selected ten additional members, creating a committee of
55; and
Whereas, Bob Goldwater, one of the early Phoenix Thunderbirds,
recommended that the group sponsor a golf tournament, which is now known as the
Waste Management Phoenix Open; and
Whereas, the Waste Management Phoenix Open quickly became a
great success and has developed into one of the leading stops on the PGA Tour;
and
Whereas, today, active membership in the Phoenix Thunderbirds
is still limited to 55 individuals and requires a sincere interest in sports
and a commitment to community affairs; and
Whereas, in 1986, Thunderbirds Charities was established as the
charitable arm of the Phoenix Thunderbirds with the purpose of granting monies
generated by the Waste Management Phoenix Open; and
Whereas, Thunderbirds Charities was created to assist children
and families, help people in need and improve the quality of life in Arizona
communities; and
Whereas, since its inception, Thunderbirds Charities has raised
over $102 million for countless Arizona charities, individuals and other
groups.
Therefore
Be it resolved by the Senate of the
State of Arizona:
That the Members of the Senate honor the members of the Phoenix
Thunderbirds and Thunderbirds Charities for their outstanding commitment to
serving the people of this state.
