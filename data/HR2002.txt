supporting trade between the united states and taiwan.


(TEXT OF BILL BEGINS ON NEXT PAGE)





Whereas, the Republic
of China (Taiwan) is Arizona's ninth largest export market and eighth largest
import market; and
Whereas, more than 56%
of total exports to Taiwan, including machinery, computer and electronic
products, come from Arizona's robust industries; and
Whereas, Taiwan is the
tenth largest trading partner of the United States and the second largest buyer
of United States agricultural products; and
Whereas, United States
trade in services with Taiwan totaled $19 billion in 2012, with the United
States registering a $4 billion surplus in services exports to Taiwan; and
Whereas, the two-way
trade volume between the United States and Taiwan was $67.3 billion in 2014;
and
Whereas, the United
States has already concluded, or is seeking to negotiate, bilateral investment
agreements (BIA) with nine of its top ten trading partners, with Taiwan being
the sole exception; and
Whereas, opening
negotiations for a BIA between the United States and Taiwan will provide more
stability for strong, two-way investment ties; and
Whereas, negotiating a
BIA between the United States and Taiwan is a win-win strategy for both
countries and will help to attract Taiwanese investment in Arizona; and
Whereas, Taiwan ranks as the tenth largest economy in terms of
trade volume among the 21 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation economies; and
Whereas, Taiwan's
participation in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a multilateral free trade
agreement among Asia-Pacific nations including the United States, would
encourage Taiwanese firms to explore investment opportunities in the United
States, including the State of Arizona, leading to the creation of quality jobs
for United States workers; and
Whereas, for United
States producers and exporters, Taiwan's integration into the TPP increases
United States market access to Taiwan as well as to mainland China; and
Whereas, the President
of the United States signed into law H.R. 1151, an act supporting Taiwan's
participation as an observer in the International Civil Aviation Organization
Assembly on July 12, 2013; and
Whereas, the
Legislature of this state also passed a concurrent resolution in support of
Taiwan's international participation in both 2012 and 2014; and
Whereas, there are
more than 60,000 Taiwanese immigrants living in the State of Arizona; and
Whereas, Arizona
maintains a strong economic and cultural relationship with Taiwan since
establishing sister-state relations over 33 years ago and is proud to join more
than 38 other states in passing resolutions supporting a United States-Taiwan
BIA or Free Trade Agreement (FTA) as well as Taiwan's participation in the TPP
and in international organizations; and
Whereas,
on January 16, 2016, Taiwan elected Dr. Tsai, Ing-wen and Dr. Chen, Chien-jen
as the country's next President and Vice President,
respectively.When Dr. Tsai is inaugurated on May 20, 2016, she will
become Taiwan's first female President. This is Taiwan's third peaceful
transfer of power through direct election and is a testament to the strength
and vitality of Taiwan's democracy.
Therefore
Be it resolved by the House of Representatives of the State of
Arizona:
1.That the Members of the House of Representatives
support the negotiation of a United States-Taiwan BIA or FTA and the
participation of Taiwan in the TPP and in international organizations and
applaud Taiwan's deepening democratization.
2.That the Secretary of State transmit a copy of
this Resolution to the President of the United States, each Member of Congress
from the State of Arizona, the United States Secretary of State and the United
States Trade Representative.
