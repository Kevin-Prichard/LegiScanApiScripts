administration shall consider implementing the following:
1.Requests for proposals for health insurance that
specify that the carrier's proposed premiums for each plan be based on the

the age, gender or health status of the individuals expected to enroll in the
particular plan for which the premium is proposed.
2.Recommendations from a legislatively established
study group on risk adjustments relating to a system for reallocating premium
revenues among the contracting qualifying plans to the extent necessary to
