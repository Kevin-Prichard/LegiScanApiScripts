(TEXT OF BILL BEGINS ON NEXT PAGE)





Whereas, Arizona is
proud to celebrate its ethnic diversity, and the people of Arizona are
fortunate to have organizations, families and individuals who are passionate
about their ancestry; and
Whereas, the Scottish
Declaration of Independence, signed on April 6, 1320, and the Scottish National
Covenant of 1638 strongly influenced the framing of America's Declaration of
Independence and the United States Constitution over 400 and 100 years later,
respectively; and
Whereas, National
Tartan Day has been celebrated on April 6 across the United States since 1997
and recognizes that Scottish Americans have played an important role throughout
American history. As some of the first immigrants to settle in America,
Scottish Americans have made enduring contributions to our society in the arts
and sciences, politics and government, technology and mathematics, military
service and many other fields; and
Whereas, the people of
Arizona recognize the heritage of Arizonans of Scottish descent and the
symbolism and pride that comes from the wearing of the tartan and colors of
their families, ancestral home and country of national origin.
Therefore
Be it resolved by the House of Representatives of the State of
Arizona, the Senate concurring:
1.That the
Members of the Legislature proclaim April 6, 2016 as Tartan Day in the State of
Arizona.
2.That the
Members of the Legislature encourage all Arizonans to observe and celebrate
Tartan Day with appropriate ceremonies and dress, including the tartans
representing our state, the Arizona Flag tartan and the Arizona Scottish
tartan, and to recognize the many contributions that Scottish Americans have
made to our great State and Nation.
