A CONCURRENT MEMORIAL

urging the
Congress of the United States to enact the Safe Freight Act.

(TEXT OF BILL BEGINS ON NEXT PAGE)





To the Congress of the United States of America:
Your memorialist respectfully represents:
Whereas, the United States has
277,722 highway-rail crossings and more than 145,000 miles of track; and
Whereas, Arizona currently has over
490 public crossings and about 3,000 railroad miles; and
Whereas, approximately 75 trains
operate in Arizona in a twentyfourhour period; and
Whereas, Arizona's railroad network
is composed of two Class I railroads, the BNSF Railway and Union Pacific, a
number of short line, terminal, industrial, switching, passenger and tourist
railroads, and one single-purpose, coal-hauling railroad, the Black Mesa and
Lake Powell Railroad, which, unlike every other Arizona railroad, is isolated
and not connected to the nationwide railroad system; and
Whereas, Arizona's railroads
originate five million tons of freight railroad traffic from locations within
Arizona, including glass and stone products, waste and scrap, primary metal
products, chemicals and metallic ores; and
Whereas, Arizona's freight
railroads bring to Arizona and terminate within the state almost 31 million
tons of freight traffic, including coal, lumber and wood products, glass and
stone products, farm products and food products; and
Whereas, several major train
derailments have occurred recently, most notably the oil train derailment and
explosion near Charleston, West Virginia in February 2015; and
Whereas, on July 6, 2013, a train
that was operated by a single crew member and that was carrying crude oil
derailed in Lac-Mgantic, Quebec, resulting in 47 fatalities and the
destruction of the town's center and sparking concerns over freight train crew
sizes; and
Whereas, multi-person crews are essential
to ensuring the safest rail operations possible; and
Whereas, the Safe Freight Act
prohibits the operation of a freight train or light locomotive engine used in
the movement of freight unless it has a crew of at least two individuals, one
of whom is certified by the Federal Rail Administration as a locomotive
operator and the other as a train conductor.
Wherefore your
memorialist, the House of Representatives of the State of Arizona, the Senate
concurring, prays:
1.That the Congress of the United States enact the
Safe Freight Act.
2.That the Secretary of State of the State of
Arizona transmit copies of this Memorial to the President of the United States
Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives and each
Member of Congress from the State of Arizona.
