Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Arizona:
Section1.Section 34-461, Arizona Revised
Statutes, is amended to read:
START_STATUTE34-461.Applicability of local codes; exception; definition
A.Public buildings shall be constructed in
compliance with the state fire code unless
a or, if the state fire
marshal authorizes through an intergovernmental agreement the city, town,
county or fire district in which the public building is located to impose the
fire code adopted by the city, town, county or fire district on public
buildings, the fire code has
been adopted by the city, town, county or fire district in which
the building is located. Public buildings shall be constructed in compliance
with applicable building, plumbing, electrical, fire prevention and mechanical codes adopted
by the city, town, county or fire district in which the building is located.
The owner of the public building is subject to the same fees required of other
persons. Public buildings are subject to inspection during construction
pursuant to these codes to determine compliance. 
B.If a public building is built in an area that has
not adopted local codes, the building shall be designed or constructed
according to the state fire code adopted by the state fire marshal and the
building, plumbing, electrical, fire prevention and mechanical codes that apply
in the largest city in the county in which the building is located.
C.Public buildings are subject to those codes that
apply and are in effect when the building is designed or constructed and to the
currently adopted codes when a building is found to be structurally unsafe,
without adequate egress or a fire hazard or is otherwise dangerous to human
life.
D.Subsections A and B of this section do not apply
to state owned buildings except for the application of the fire code in effect
where a state owned building is located. In complying with the applicable
codes pursuant to subsections A and B of this section, the permitting process
and fees do not apply to a public school district owned building in a county
with a population of more than seven hundred fifty thousand persons but less
than two million persons except for the application of the design and
permitting process and any fee required of a fire code in effect where such a
public school district owned building is located.State department
of corrections facilities are exempt from the application of the local fire
code in the absence of an intergovernmental agreement between the state
department of corrections and the governmental entity responsible for enforcing
any local fire code.
E.Notwithstanding
subsection A of this section, cities prescribed in section 412163,
subsection A, paragraph 2 do not have authority that supersedes and are not
exempt from the state fire safety committee's established fire code in state or
county owned buildings and public schools wherever located throughout the
state.
F.E.This
section does not preclude a public school district in a county with a
population of more than seven hundred fifty thousand persons but less than two
million persons from submitting, at its discretion, to the building design or
construction permitting process of the appropriate local government entity for
any given project.A public school district making such a decision
is subject to subsections A and B of this section and the permit and code
compliance requirements of the local government entity, including inspections
and fee payments that may be required, for the duration of the project that the
district submitted to the local government entity.
G.F.Public
school districts in a county with a population of more than seven hundred fifty
thousand persons but less than two million persons shall adopt policies to
provide requirements to be followed by licensed or registered contractors or
employees in order to ensure that construction
projects are in compliance with the applicable codes pursuant to subsections A
and B of this section and that records required by code or law for a given
project are completed and maintained by the applicable district. At a
minimum, these policies shall:
1.Include the method by which the public school
district will notify the appropriate local government unit or units, and retain
a record of the notification, that the public school district will not be using
the permitting process for a given project pursuant to subsection D of this
section.
2.Prohibit a construction contractor from serving
as a district's inspector and code compliance official on the same project for
which the contractor is providing construction services.
3.Require the architect of record for a given
district project to be
responsible for signing the certificate of occupancy when such a certificate is
required for that particular project.
H.G.For
the purposes of this section, "public building" means a building or
appurtenance to a building that is built in whole or in part with public
monies. END_STATUTE
