A.In a jurisdiction that uses punch card ballots,
the early election board, immediately upon on receipt of the early
ballots, shall, as provided
by this section, shall cast
separately for each precinct the early ballots which
that have been received.In a jurisdiction that uses
optical scan ballots, the officer in charge of elections may use the procedure
prescribed by this section or may request approval from the secretary of state
for a different method for processing early ballots.The request
shall be made in writing at least ninety days before the election for which the
procedure is intended to be used. After the election official has confirmed
with the secretary of state that all election equipment passes the logic and
accuracy test, the election official may begin to count early ballots. No
early ballot results may be released except as prescribed by section 16551.
B.The early election board shall check the voter's
affidavit on the envelope containing the early ballot. If it is found to be
sufficient, the vote shall be allowed. If the affidavit is insufficient, the vote shall not be allowed the county recorder or other officer in
charge of elections shall provide for a method of notifying the early ballot
voter at no cost to the voter that there is a defect in the voter's ballot
materials that will result in the rejection of the voter's ballot from being counted
and that the voter may attempt to cure the defect in the voting materials
within the ten days immediately following the election.The county
recorder or other officer in charge of elections shall permit the voter to cure
those defects that result from incomplete or incorrect information, shall
tabulate the ballot as otherwise provided by law and shall further notify the
voter whether the voter's ballot was verified and counted and, if not counted,
the reason for not counting the ballot.The method of notification
shall include reasonable restrictions that are designed to limit transmittal of
the information only to the voter.END_STATUTE
C.The county chairman of each political party
represented on the ballot may,
by written appointment addressed to the early election board, may designate party representatives and
alternates to act as early ballot challengers for the party.No
party may have more than the number of such representatives or alternates which that were mutually agreed upon on
by each political party to be present at one time.If
such agreement cannot be reached, the number of representatives shall be
limited to one for each political party.
D.An early ballot may be challenged on any grounds
set forth in section 16591.All challenges shall be made in
writing with a brief statement of the grounds prior to
before the early ballot being is placed in the ballot
box.A record of all challenges and resulting proceedings shall be
kept in substantially the same manner as provided in section 16594.If
an early ballot is challenged, it shall be set aside and retained in the
possession of the early election board or other officer in charge of early
ballot processing until a time that the early election board sets for
determination of the challenge, subject to the procedure in subsection E of
this section, at which time the earlyelection board shall hear the
grounds for the challenge and shall decide what disposition shall be made of
the early ballot by majority vote.If the early ballot is not
allowed, it shall be handled pursuant to subsection G of this section.
E.Within twentyfour hours of receipt of a
challenge, the early election board or other officer in charge of early ballot
processing shall mail, by first class mail, a notice of the challenge including
a copy of the written challenge, and also including the time and place at which
the voter may appear to defend the challenge, to the voter at the mailing
address shown on the request for an early ballot or, if none was provided, to
the mailing address shown on the registration rolls. Notice shall also be
mailed to the challenger at the address listed on the written challenge and
provided to the county chairman of each political party represented on the
ballot.The board shall meet to determine the challenge at the time
specified by the notice but, in any event, not earlier than ninetysix
hours after the notice is mailed, or fortyeight hours if the notifying
party chooses to deliver the notice by overnight or hand delivery, and not
later than 5:00 p.m. on the Monday following the election.The board
shall provide the voter with an informal opportunity to make, or to submit,
brief statements regarding the challenge.The board may decline to
permit comments, either in person or in writing, by anyone other than the
voter, the challenger and the party representatives.The burden of
proof is on the challenger to show why the voter should not be permitted to
vote.The fact that the voter fails to appear shall not be deemed to
be an admission of the validity of the challenge.The early election
board or other officer in charge of early ballot processing is not required to
provide the notices described in this subsection if the written challenge fails
to set forth at least one of the grounds listed in section 16591 as a
basis for the challenge.In that event, the challenge will be
summarily rejected at the meeting of the board. Except for election contests
pursuant to section 16672, the board's decision is final and may not be
appealed.
F.If the vote is allowed, the board shall open the
envelope containing the ballot in such a manner that the affidavit thereon is
not destroyed, take out the ballot without unfolding it or permitting it to be
opened or examined and show by the records of the election that the elector has
voted.
G.If the vote is not allowed, the affidavit
envelope containing the early ballot shall not be opened and the board shall
mark across the face of such envelope the grounds for rejection.The
affidavit envelope and its contents shall then be deposited with the opened
affidavit envelopes and shall be preserved with official returns.If
the voter does not enter an appearance, the board shall send the voter a notice
stating whether theearly ballot was disallowed and, if disallowed,
providing the grounds for the determination.The notice shall be
mailed by first class mail to the voter's mailing address as shown on the
registration rolls within three days after the board's determination.
H.Party representatives and alternates may be
appointed as provided in subsection C of this section to be present and to
challenge the verification of questioned ballots pursuant to section 16584
on any grounds permitted by this section.Questioned ballots which that are challenged shall be presented to the
early election board for decision under the provisions of this section. END_STATUTE
