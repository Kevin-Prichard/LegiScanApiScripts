this section shall be conducted in the same manner as elections prescribed in
subsections C through G of this section and shall be held concurrently as
prescribed in section 15458.
J.If the consolidated district includes territory
located in two or more counties, the county of jurisdiction is the county in
which the largest number of qualified electors of the consolidated school
district resides, except that if all of the existing school buildings are in
one county, that county is the county of jurisdiction.The county
school superintendent of the jurisdictional county shall perform all duties for
and with respect to the consolidated school district as required to be
performed by county school superintendents.The board of supervisors
of the jurisdictional county shall perform all duties for and with respect to
the consolidated school district as required to be performed by boards of
supervisors, except that school district taxes to be levied on property in the
portion of the consolidated school district lying in another county shall be
levied by the board of supervisors of the other county or counties and on
receipt shall be transferred to the county of jurisdiction.All
school buildings located within the consolidated school district, together with
all equipment and furnishings, become the property of the consolidated school
district.Any assumed indebtedness is an indebtedness of the
consolidated school district for the purpose of determining the debt incurring

K.Sections 15457, 15975 and 15997
apply to school districts that are consolidated as provided in subsection H of
this section.
L.Consolidation pursuant to this section is not

current year of more than ten per cent
percent of the total
student count of all school districts in this state.
M.The governing board is constituted, may conduct
meetings and shall prepare policies, curricula and budgets for the new school
district
after the canvass pursuant to subsection G of this section
demonstrates that a majority of the votes cast in each school district approved
the consolidation.These policies shall require that:
1.The base salary and benefits of each employee for
the first year of operation of the new school district shall not be lower than
the employee's base salary and benefits for the prior year in the previously
existing school district.
2.The employee's years of employment in the
previously existing school district shall be included in determining the
employee's years of employment in the new school district.An
employee who was entitled to continuing employment contract status in the
previously existing school district is entitled to continuing employment
contract status in the new school district.
3.Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 and 2 of this
subsection and pursuant to section 15544, nothing in this section shall
be construed to restrict the ability of the governing board to implement a
reduction in force or to scale back salaries of certified teachers, administrators
or noncertificated employees for reasons of economy or to improve the efficient
conduct of schools within the district following a school district
consolidation.
N.If all of the districts to be consolidated have
authorization for an override as provided in section 15481 that would
have continued after the consolidation, the override authorization continues
for the new district and expires at the time that the earliest override would
have expired.
O.If one or more, but not all, of the districts to
be consolidated have authorization for an override as provided in section 15481
that would have continued after the consolidation, the override authorization
shall only apply to the schools included under the terms of the prior override
authorization. Consolidation of school districts does not consolidate or pool
the liability to be taxed for the override, and only property that was located
within the boundaries of the district that approved the override prior to
consolidation is to pay taxes to support the override.This
subsection also applies if all of the districts to be consolidated have
authorization for overrides, but the authorizations are pursuant to different
subsections of section 15481 or the override amounts are not the same
percentage of the revenue control limit.
P.Notwithstanding section 15457,
consolidation of school districts does not consolidate or pool the liability of
the former school districts into the resulting school
district.Outstanding indebtedness incurred by a school district
before consolidation shall be repaid without interruption according to existing
debt schedules as determined by the county board of supervisors. If a school
district consolidates after July 1, 2004, the new school district may pay
tuition to the district of attendance when a pupil is precluded by distance or
lack of transportation from attending school in the district of a pupil's
residence.
Q.If one or more of the previously existing school
districts were authorized to budget for expenses of complying with or
continuing to implement activities that were required or permitted by court
order of desegregation or administrative agreement with the United States
department of education office for civil rights directed toward remediating
alleged or proven racial discrimination pursuant to section 15910, this
authorization does not expire on the effective date of consolidation but only
applies to schools included in the court order or administrative agreement.
R.If one or
more of the previously existing school districts were participating in a career
ladder program pursuant to chapter 9, article 1.1 of this title before
consolidation, notwithstanding any other law the state board shall expedite the
processing of and may approve an updated application for program reapproval
that incorporates the geographic boundaries of the resulting school district
and the inclusion of the additional staff in the career ladder program.
S.R.If the formation
of a new consolidated and unified school district is authorized, the terms of
the governing board members of the common and union high school districts do
not expire on the effective date of the unification.The governing
board members of the previously existing school districts shall serve as
provided in section 15430, except that the power of the governing board
members of the previously existing school districts acting as the governing
board of the unified school district is limited to the maintenance and
operation of the previously existing school districts and compliance with the
consolidation and unification plan. END_STATUTE
