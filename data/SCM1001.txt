(TEXT OF BILL BEGINS ON NEXT PAGE)





To the President of the United States, the Congress of the
United States and the Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau:
Your memorialist respectfully represents:
Whereas, in January
2014, mortgage standards required by the federal Dodd-Frank law and set by the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) went into effect; and
Whereas, the CFPB
rules create a qualified mortgage, which is an attempt to incentivize safer
loans by offering lenders a safe harbor against liability in court; and
Whereas, consumers,
small businesses, banks, realtors and mortgage lenders have expressed serious
concerns with the current CFPB rules; and
Whereas, many
commonsense lending practices are no longer allowed by the new rules; and
Whereas, these rules
are too restrictive and have resulted in fewer lenders offering loans and make
it harder for even low-risk consumers to buy houses, damaging the Arizona
economy; and
Whereas, many small
business owners who have excellent credit ratings and a great track record of
paying their existing mortgages on time are being turned down for new mortgages
or mortgage refinancing due to these restrictive federal regulations; and
Whereas, the new
federal rules are resulting in the denial of loans to low-risk consumers who
deserve loans, simply because they cannot prove adequate income on their
Schedule C tax forms, regardless of mitigating circumstances; and
Whereas, prior to
Dodd-Frank, commonsense mortgage lending practices for small business owners
and self-employed people involving alternative methods to prove ability to
repay historically resulted in some of the highest repayment rates of any loans
on the market; and
Whereas, prior to
Dodd-Frank, many small businesses obtained significant capital investment to
grow their businesses by refinancing their personal homes, a source of capital
now severely limited by Dodd-Frank; and
Whereas, since the
enactment of Dodd-Frank, many potential homebuyers and those seeking to
refinance existing home loans are unable to obtain any mortgage at any price,
even if they have a long history of paying their debts and prior mortgages and are
clearly able to repay the loan.
Wherefore your memorialist, the Senate of the State of Arizona,
the House of Representatives concurring, prays:
1.That the
Members of the Legislature urge the President, Congress and CFPB to broaden the
qualified mortgage underwriting rules to enshrine commonsense lending practices
including allowing individuals to demonstrate their ability to repay through
methods other than income documentation, such as proof of a high credit rating,
a long track record of paying monthly mortgages on time, liquid assets greater
than the mortgage amount or significant business net worth or consumer net
worth, or both.
2.That the
Members of the Legislature urge the President, Congress and CFPB to allow
lenders to exceed the 43% debt-to-income ratio ceiling and still maintain a
safe harbor if the borrower meets other criteria that demonstrate an ability to
pay.
3.That the
Members of the Legislature urge the President, Congress and CFPB to create a
fee schedule that allows lenders, within reason, to price loans according to
risk instead of a flat 3% maximum fee.
4.That
the Secretary of State of the State of Arizona transmit a copy of this Memorial
to the President of the United States, the President of the United States
Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, each Member
of Congress from the State of Arizona and the Director of the CFPB.
