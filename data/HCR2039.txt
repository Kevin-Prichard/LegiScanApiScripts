(TEXT OF BILL BEGINS ON NEXT PAGE)





Whereas, Multiple
Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic and often devastating neurological disease of the
central nervous system that affects at least 2.3 million people worldwide; and
Whereas, the Arizona Chapter of the National Multiple Sclerosis
Society reports that this state serves more than 8,000 individuals who have
been diagnosed with MS, affecting 40,000 family members; and
Whereas, MS generally
strikes people in the prime of life, between the ages of 20 and 50; and
Whereas, MS generally
causes unpredictable effects, and the progression, severity and specific
symptoms of each case cannot be foreseen; and
Whereas, the cause and
cure for this often debilitating disease remain unknown; and
Whereas, for more than
65 years, the Arizona Chapter of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society has
been committed to creating a world free of MS by heightening public knowledge
about and insight into the disease while mobilizing people and resources so
that those affected by MS can live their best lives; and
Whereas, the Arizona
Chapter of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society continues to work to stop MS
in its tracks, restore what has been lost and end MS forever; and
Whereas, since 1946,
the National Multiple Sclerosis Society has been a driving force of MS
research, relentlessly pursuing prevention, treatment and a cure, and has
invested more than $920 million in groundbreaking research; and
Whereas, monies raised
through the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, totaling nearly $54 million
annually, fuel the efforts of more than 380 research projects globally at the
best medical centers and universities and at other institutions throughout the
United States and abroad. Because of this, MS research has never been more
hopeful than it is today; and
Whereas, discovering
the cause, finding a cure and preventing future generations from being
diagnosed with MS are important tasks that all Americans and Arizonans should
support.
Therefore
Be it resolved by the House of Representatives of the State of
Arizona, the Senate concurring:
1.That the
Members of the Legislature recognize the individuals and their families who
have been impacted by MS and acknowledge that they are great assets to this
state.
2.That the
Members of the Legislature support the men, women and families of all people
who have been diagnosed with MS and other neurological diseases.
3.That the
Members of the Legislature recognize the importance of finding the cause of and
cure for MS and express their appreciation for the dedication that the Arizona
Chapter of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society and its members have shown
toward a MS-free future.
4.That the
Members of the Legislature proclaim March 7 through 13, 2016 as Multiple
Sclerosis Awareness Week in Arizona and encourage all citizens to learn more
about MS and what they can do to support individuals with the disease and their
families.
