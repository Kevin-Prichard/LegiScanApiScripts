and S. 1709, the 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act of2015.


(TEXT OF BILL BEGINS ON NEXT PAGE)





To the Congress of the United States of America:
Your memorialist respectfully
represents:
Whereas, an effective monetary and
banking system is essential to the proper functioning of the United States
economy; and
Whereas, an effective monetary and
banking system must function in the public interest without bias; and
Whereas, certain provisions of the
Banking Act of 1933, commonly referred to as the Glass-Steagall Act, protected
the public interest in matters dealing with the regulation of commercial and
investment banking, in addition to insurance companies and securities firms;
and
Whereas, the Glass-Steagall Act was
repealed in 1999, during the Clinton Administration, contributing to the
greatest speculative bubble and worldwide recession since the Great Depression
by permitting members of the financial industry to exploit the financial system
for their own gain in disregard of the public interest; and
Whereas, the worldwide recession
caused the loss of millions of jobs nationwide and contributed to millions of
homes being foreclosed, while many financial industry entities were saved by
the United States Treasury at the cost of billions of dollars to the American
taxpayers; and
Whereas, the worldwide recession
also put severe financial strains on states, counties and cities, exacerbating
unemployment and the loss of civil services; and
Whereas, within the hundreds of
pages of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, there
are no prohibitions that prevent "too big to fail" financial services
organizations from investing in or undertaking substantial risks involving
trillions of dollars of derivative contracts; and
Whereas, the American taxpayers
continue to be at risk for the next round of bank failures as enormous risks
are undertaken by financial services conglomerates; and
Whereas, since 2011, bipartisan
legislation has been introduced in both the United States Senate and the United
States House of Representatives to revive the separation between commercial banking
and the Wall Street securities business in the manner provided in the Banking
Act of 1933, the so-called "Glass-Steagall Act"; and
Whereas, on January 14, 2015,
Democratic Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur introduced H.R. 381, known as the Return
to Prudent Banking Act of 2015, with cosponsor Republican Congressman Walter
Jones; and
Whereas, on July 7, 2015, United
States Senators Elizabeth Warren, Maria Cantwell, John McCain and Angus King
introduced S. 1709, the 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act of 2015, which would
reduce risk for American taxpayers in the financial system and decrease the
likelihood of future financial crises; and
Whereas, members of both the United
States House of Representatives and United States Senate have been making
efforts to restore the protections of the Glass-Steagall Act by reviving the
separation between commercial banking and the securities business in the manner
provided by the Glass-Steagall Act, which would reduce risk for American
taxpayers in the financial system and decrease the likelihood of future
financial crises; and
Whereas, reinstatement of the
Glass-Steagall Act provisions has widespread national support from prominent
economic and business leaders and national publications, including Thomas
Hoenig of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, former Citigroup Chief
Executive Officer Sanford Weill, economist Luigi Zingales, the New York Times,
the St. Louis PostDispatch, the Los Angeles Times and many others; and
Whereas, to date, legislation
requesting action to restore the GlassSteagall standard has been
introduced in one or both legislative chambers in more than half the states.
Legislative bodies in at least four states have passed those resolutions, and
in the remaining states legislative action is still pending; and
Whereas, overwhelming pressure must
be brought to bear on members of the United States House of Representatives and
United States Senate to take action to pass this important legislation.
Wherefore your
memorialist, the House of Representatives of the State of Arizona, the Senate
concurring, prays:
1.That the Members of
the United States Congress enact H.R. 381, the Return to Prudent Banking Act of
2015, and S. 1709, the 21st Century GlassSteagall Act of 2015.
2.That the Members of
the United States Congress and the President of the United States enact
legislation that, in order to prevent American taxpayers from funding hundreds
of billions of dollars to bail out financial institutions, would reinstate the
separation of commercial and investment banking functions in effect under the
Glass-Steagall Act by prohibiting commercial banks and bank holding companies
from investing in stocks, underwriting securities or investing in or acting as
guarantors to derivative transactions.
3.That the Secretary of
State of the State of Arizona transmit copies of this Memorial to the President
of the United States, the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of
the United States House of Representatives, each Member of Congress from the
State of Arizona, United
States Representatives Marcy Kaptur and Walter Jones and
United States Senators Elizabeth Warren, Maria Cantwell, John McCain and Angus
King.
