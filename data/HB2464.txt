Sec.2.Section 13-4092, Arizona Revised
Statutes, is amended to read:
START_STATUTE13-4092.Summoning witness in this state to testify in another
state; licensed health care providers
A.If a judge of a court of record in any state
which by its laws has made provision for commanding persons within that state
to attend and testify in this state certifies under the seal of such court that
there is a criminal prosecution pending in such court, or that a grand jury
investigation has commenced or is about to commence, that a person being within
this state is a material witness in such prosecution, or grand jury
investigation, and that his presence will be required for a specified number of
days, upon presentation of such certificate to any judge of a court of record
in the county in which such person is, such judge shall fix a time and place
for a hearing, and shall make an order directing the witness to appear at a
time and place certain for a hearing.
B.If at a hearing the judge determines that the
witness is material and necessary, that it will not cause undue hardship to the
witness to be compelled to attend and testify in the prosecution or a grand
jury investigation in the other state, and that the laws of the state in which
the prosecution is pending, or grand jury investigation has commenced or is
about to commence, will give to him protection from arrest and the service of
civil and criminal process, he shall issue a summons, with a copy of the
certificate attached, directing the witness to attend and testify in the court
where the prosecution is pending, or where a grand jury investigation has
commenced or is about to commence at a time and place specified in the
summons.In any such hearing the certificate shall be prima facie
evidence of all the facts stated therein.
C.If the certificate recommends that the witness be
taken into immediate custody and delivered to an officer of the requesting
state to assure his attendance in the requesting state, such judge may, in lieu
of notification of the hearing, direct that such witness be forthwith brought
before him for the hearing; and the judge at the hearing being satisfied of the
desirability of such custody and delivery, for which determination the
certificate shall be prima facie proof of such desirability may, in lieu of
issuing subpoena or summons, order that the witness be forthwith taken into
custody and delivered to an officer of the requesting state.
D.If the witness, who is summoned as above
provided, after being paid or tendered by some properly authorized person the
sum of ten cents a mile for each mile by the ordinary traveled route to and
from the court where the prosecution is pending and five dollars for each day
that he is required to travel and attend as a witness, fails without good cause
to attend and testify as directed in the summons, he shall be punished in the
manner provided for the punishment of a witness who disobeys a summons issued
from a court of record in this state.
E.If the
witness, who is summoned as above provided, is a licensed health care provider
as defined in section 12561, the laws in this state and all privileges,
defenses and protections available under the laws of this state apply to the
witness in all hearings, proceedings and adjudications in the criminal
prosecution and grand jury investigation, regardless of the law in the
requesting state. END_STATUTE
