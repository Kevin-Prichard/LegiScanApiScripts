each license plate that is issued by the department, except a license plate
that is issued pursuant to article 12, 13 or 14 of this chapter, be replaced
every seven years by a new license plate that is issued by the department.At
the request of the owner and on payment of any required fee, the department
shall provide either one or two license plates for a vehicle for which a
special plate is requested pursuant to this chapter, except that the department
shall provide one license plate if the special plate is issued pursuant to
section 282416 or 282416.01.
B.The license plate shall display the number
assigned to the vehicle and to the owner of the vehicle and the name of this
state, which may be abbreviated.The director shall coat the license
plate with a reflective material that is consistent with the determination of
the department regarding the color and design of license plates and special
plates.The director shall design the license plate and the letters
and numerals on the license plate to be of sufficient size to be plainly
readable during daylight from a distance of one hundred feet.In
addition to the standard license plate issued for a trailer before August 12,
2005, the director shall issue a license plate for trailers that has a design
that is similar to the standard size license plate for trailers but that is the
same size as the license plate for motorcycles.The trailer owner
shall notify the department which size license plate the owner wants for the
trailer.
C.Notwithstanding any other law, the department
shall not contract with a nongovernmental entity to purchase or secure
reflective material for the plates issued by the department unless the
department has made a reasonable effort to secure qualified bids or proposals
from as many individual responsible respondents as possible.
D.The department shall determine the color and
design of the license plate. If
the department requires that the license plate be replaced and a new license
plate be issued pursuant to subsection A of this section, the department shall
change the color and design of the new LICENSE PLATE. All other plates
issued by the department, except the plates issued pursuant to sections 282404,
