Sec.2.Section 44-291, Arizona Revised
Statutes, is amended to read:
START_STATUTE44-291.Computation of interest; prepayment rebate; additional
charges; secondary motor vehicle finance transaction; definitions
A.Except as provided in subsections G and H of this
section, under a retail installment contract it is lawful to charge and receive
interest not to exceed the maximum rate set by contract.
B.The finance charge may be computed either at a
single annual percentage rate using the actuarial method or it may be
precomputed on the assumption that all payments will be made in the amount and
on the dates scheduled.If the finance charge is precomputed, the
fact that payments are made either before or after the date due does not affect
the amount of finance charge which
the seller or holder may charge or receive.If the precomputed contract
balance is prepaid in full by cash, a new loan, refinancing or otherwise, the
seller or holder shall charge only for the finance charge which that
has been earned and unpaid late payment or delinquency charges as
of the date of prepayment, and the buyer shall receive a rebate of that portion
of the precomputed finance charge which
that is the difference
between the total precomputed finance charges and the charges at the contract
finance charge computed on the unpaid principal balance based on the number of
days or months to maturity based on either a thirty day monththree
hundred sixty day year or daily three hundred sixtyfive or three hundred
sixtysix day year on the number of days remaining to final maturity,
except that the number of days shall be the same as that used in calculating
the finance charge as prescribed in subsection C of this section. The amount of
such that rebate shall not be computed pursuant to
the method commonly known as the "rule of 78's".To
simplify the calculation of earned finance charge, it is permissible to assume
that all payments were made as originally scheduled or as otherwise mutually
agreed.
C.It is permissible to calculate a finance charge
on an annual basis of twelve months of thirty days each, or on a daily basis if
a day is counted as 1/360th, 1/365th,
or 1/366th of a year, as the buyer and seller or holder may agree by
writing.The seller or holder may also charge a late payment or
delinquency charge, in addition to all finance charges permitted, on each installment
not paid in full on the tenth day after its due date in an amount not to exceed
five per cent percent of the unpaid balance
of the installment.
D.In addition to the cash sale price of the
vehicle, the seller may charge for any insurance premiums incurred in
connection with the retail installment transaction.
E.Notwithstanding the late payment or delinquency
charge provided in subsection C of this section, in a commercial transaction,
the seller or holder may charge a late payment or delinquency charge, in
addition to all finance charges permitted, on each installment not paid in full
on the tenth day after its due date in an amount of not more than five per cent percent of the unpaid balance of the
installment.
F.Any sales finance company may purchase or acquire
or agree to purchase or acquire from any seller any contract on such terms and
conditions as may be agreed on between them.Filing of the
assignment notice to the buyer of the assignment and any requirement that the
holder maintain dominion over the payments or the motor vehicle if repossessed
is not necessary to the validity of a written assignment of a contract as
against creditors, subsequent purchasers, pledgees, mortgagees and lien
claimants of the seller. Unless the buyer has notice of the assignment of his
contract, payment under the contract made by the buyer to the last known holder
of such contract is binding on all subsequent holders.
G.If the retail installment contract is a secondary
motor vehicle finance transaction, the seller, bailor, lender or lessor shall
determine the annual secondary motor vehicle finance rate and all charges
relating to the sale, conditional sale, bailment or lease and repurchase of the
vehicle. The seller, bailor, lender or lessor shall calculate the annual
secondary motor vehicle finance rate by multiplying the monthly secondary motor
vehicle finance rate by twelve. A retail installment contract that is a
secondary motor vehicle finance transaction is subject to a maximum finance charge of not more than thirtysix
percent a year.For the purposes of this subsection, "finance
charge" includes all interest, charges for ancillary products that are
sold in connection with the secondary motor vehicle finance transaction and any
other charges that are incidental to the extension of credit. the following maximum finance rates on a
secondary motor vehicle finance contract in the original principal amount of:
1.Five
hundred dollars or less, a monthly finance rate of seventeen per cent.
2.More than five
hundred dollars but not more than two thousand five hundred dollars, a monthly
finance rate of fifteen per cent.
3.More than
two thousand five hundred dollars but not more than five thousand dollars, a
monthly finance rate of thirteen per cent.
4.More than
five thousand dollars, a monthly finance rate of ten per cent.
H.Except as the result of an accidental or bona
fide error, if the licensee charges, contracts for or receives any amount in
excess of the finance charges and other fees expressly permitted by this
chapter, the secondary motor vehicle transaction is voidable
void and the licensee has no right to collect or receive any
principal, finance charges or other fees in connection with that secondary
motor vehicle finance transaction.Any secondary motor vehicle
finance transaction that is made by a person who is located in this state or another state and who
is required to be licensed pursuant to this chapter but who is not licensed is
void, and the person has no right to collect, receive or retain any principal,
finance charges or other fees in connection with that secondary motor vehicle
finance transaction. An act or
practice that results in a secondary motor vehicle finance transaction being
void under this subsection is an unlawful practice under section 441522
and is subject to enforcement and penalties under chapter 10, article 7 of this
title.
I.Section 44287, subsection B does not apply
to a secondary motor vehicle finance transaction if the contract complies with
the disclosure requirements prescribed in federal law.The seller
shall conspicuously disclose in the contract the annual secondary motor vehicle
finance rate.
J.For the purposes
of this section:
1."Actuarial
method" means the method of allocating payments made on a debt between the
unpaid principal balance and the finance charge pursuant to which a payment is
applied first to the finance charge due and any remainder is subtracted from
the unpaid principal balance.
2."Commercial transaction" means a
transaction in which the motor vehicle is intended by the borrower for use
primarily for other than personal, family or household purposes. END_STATUTE
