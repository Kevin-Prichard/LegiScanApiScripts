service; definitions
A.Before an admission, procedure or
service and on the request of a patient or prospective patient who is an
employee of this state, a health care entity, within two working days, shall
disclose the allowed amount, if the health care entity is in the patient's
insurer network, or the amount that will be charged, if the health care entity
is outside the patient's insurer network, of the admission, procedure or
service, including the amount for any facility fees required. If a health care
entity is unable to quote a specific amount in advance due to the health care
entity's inability to predict the specific treatment or diagnostic code, the
health care entity shall disclose what is known for the estimated allowed
amount, if the health care entity is in the patient's insurer network, or the
amount that will be charged, if the health care entity is outside the patient's
insurer network, for a proposed admission, procedure or service, including the
amount for any facility fees required. The health care entity shall disclose
the incomplete nature of the estimate and inform the patient or prospective
patient of the patient's or prospective patient's ability to obtain an updated
estimate once additional information is obtained.
B.If
a patient or prospective patient who is an employee of this state is covered by
insurance, a health care entity that participates in the health insurer's
network on request of the patient or prospective patient, based on the
information available to the health care entity at the time of the request,
shall provide sufficient information regarding the proposed admission,
procedure or service for the patient or prospective patient to use that health
insurer's applicable tollfree telephone number and website to disclose
outofpocket costs pursuant to section 38651.07. A health
care entity may assist a patient or prospective patient in using a health
insurer's toll-free telephone number and website.
C.For
the purposes of this section:
1."Allowed
amount" means the contractually agreed on amount paid by a health insurer
to a health care entity for health care services provided to a patient who is
covered by insurance.
2."Health
care entity" means a person who is licensed pursuant to title 32, chapter
13 or 17, hospital, outpatient surgical center, health care laboratory,

START_STATUTE38-651.07.Cost of health care services; estimate; payment;
definitions
A.A health insurer offering a health
plan to this state for the health insurance coverage of state employees shall
comply with all of the following requirements with respect to the costs of
health care services: 
1.The
health insurer shall establish a tollfree telephone number and website
that enables an enrollee to request and obtain from the health insurer
information on the average price paid in the past twelve months to a network
health care provider for a proposed admission, procedure or service in each
geographic rating area established by the health insurer and to request an
estimate pursuant to paragraph 2 of this subsection.
2.Within
two business days after an enrollee's request, a health insurer shall provide
an estimate for the maximum allowed amount or charge for a proposed admission,
procedure or service and the estimated amount the enrollee will be responsible
to pay for a proposed admission, procedure or service that is a medically
necessary covered benefit, based on the information available to the health
insurer at the time the request is made and including any facility fee, copayment,
deductible, coinsurance or other outofpocket amount for any
covered health care benefits. An enrollee is not required to pay more than the
disclosed amounts for the covered health care benefits that were actually
provided, except that this paragraph does not prohibit a health insurer from
imposing cost sharing requirements disclosed in the enrollee's certificate of
coverage for unforeseen health care services that arise out of the proposed
admission, procedure or service. A health insurer shall notify an enrollee
that these are estimated costs and that the actual amount the enrollee will be
responsible to pay may vary due to unforeseen services that arise out of the
proposed admission, procedure or service.
3.If
an enrollee elects to receive health care services from a provider that costs
less than the average cost for a particular admission, procedure or service,
the enrollee's health insurer shall pay to the enrollee fifty percent of the
saved cost, except that the health insurer is not required to make a payment if
the saved cost is less than fifty dollars. If an enrollee has an outofnetwork
benefit and the enrollee elects to receive health care services from an outofnetwork
provider that costs less than the average cost for a particular admission,
procedure or service, a health insurer shall apply the enrollee's share of the
cost of those health care services as specified in the enrollee's health plan
toward the enrollee's outofpocket limit as if the health care
services were provided by a network provider.
B.For
the purposes of this section, "allowed amount", "health care
entity" and "health insurer" have the same meanings prescribed
in section 38651.06. END_STATUTE 
Sec.2.Applicability
