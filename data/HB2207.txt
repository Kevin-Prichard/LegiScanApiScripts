online schools. The state board of education and stateapproved charter
authorizers shall develop standards for the approval of online course providers
and online schools based on the following criteria:
1.The depth and breadth of curriculum choices.
2.The variety of educational methodologies employed
by the school and the means of addressing the unique needs and learning styles
of targeted pupil populations, including computerassisted learning
systems, virtual classrooms, virtual laboratories, electronic field trips,
electronic mail, virtual tutoring, online help desk, group chat sessions and

network to safeguard pupils against predatory and pornographic elements of the

7.The extent to which the school intends to develop
partnerships with universities, community colleges and private businesses.
8.The services offered to populations with

9.The grade levels that will be served.
B.Each new school that provides online instruction
shall provide online instruction on a probationary status.After a
new school that provides online instruction has clearly demonstrated the
academic integrity of its instruction through the actual improvement of the
academic performance of its students, the school may apply to be removed from
probationary status. The state board of education or the stateapproved
charter authorizer that sponsored the charter school shall remove from Arizona
online instruction any probationary school that fails to clearly demonstrate
improvement in academic performance within three years measured against goals
in the approved application and the state's accountability system. All pupils
who participate in Arizona online instruction shall reside in this state.
Pupils who participate in Arizona online instruction are subject to the testing
requirements prescribed in chapter 7, article 3 of this title.On
enrollment, the school shall notify the parents or guardians of the pupil of
the state testing requirements.If a pupil fails to comply with the
testing requirements and the school administers the tests pursuant to this
subsection to less than ninetyfive percent of the pupils in Arizona
online instruction, the pupil shall not be allowed to participate in Arizona
online instruction.
C.The state board of education and stateapproved
charter authorizers shall develop annual reporting mechanisms for schools that
participate in Arizona online instruction. The annual reporting mechanisms shall require each provider
of Arizona online instruction to submit to the superintendent of public
instruction on or before September 30 a student accountability report that
includes a list of the number of pupils who registered during the previous
fiscal year for online courses by course title, the number of pupils who
completed each course and the grades those pupils received.
D.The department of education shall compile the
information submitted in the annual reports by schools participating in Arizona
online instruction. The department of education shall submit the compiled
report to the governor, the speaker of the house of representatives and the
president of the senate by November 15 of each year.
E.Each school selected for Arizona online
instruction shall ensure that a daily log is maintained for each pupil who
participates in Arizona online instruction. The daily log shall describe the
amount of time spent by each pupil participating in Arizona online instruction
pursuant to this section on academic tasks.The daily log shall be
used by the school district or charter school to qualify the pupils who
participate in Arizona online instruction in the school's average daily
attendance calculations pursuant to subsection F of this section.
F.If a pupil is enrolled in a school district or
charter school and also participates in Arizona online instruction, the sum of
the average daily membership, which includes enrollment as prescribed in
section 15901, subsection A, paragraph 1, subdivisions (a) and (b) and
daily attendance as prescribed in section 15901, subsection A, paragraph
5, for that pupil in the school district or charter school and in Arizona
online instruction shall not exceed 1.0. If the pupil is enrolled in a school
district or a charter school and also participates in Arizona online
instruction and the sum of the daily membership or daily attendance for that
pupil is greater than 1.0, the sum shall be reduced to 1.0 and shall be
apportioned between the school district, unless the school district is a joint
technical education district subject to the apportionment requirements of
section 15393, or charter school and Arizona online instruction based on
the percentage of total time that the pupil is enrolled or in attendance in the
school district or charter school and Arizona online
instruction.The uniform system of financial records shall include
guidelines for the apportionment of the pupil enrollment and attendance as
provided in this subsection. Pupils in Arizona online instruction do not incur
absences for purposes of this subsection and may generate an average daily
attendance of 1.0 for attendance hours during any hour of the day, during any
day of the week and at any time between July 1 and June 30 of each fiscal
year. For kindergarten programs and grades one through eight, average daily
membership shall be calculated by dividing the instructional hours as reported
in the daily log required in subsection E of this section by the applicable
hourly requirements prescribed in section 15901. For grades nine
through twelve, average daily membership shall be calculated by dividing the
instructional hours as reported in the daily log required in subsection E of
this section by nine hundred.The average daily membership of a
pupil who participates in online instruction shall not exceed
1.0.Average daily membership shall not be calculated on the one
hundredth day of instruction for the purposes of this
section.Funding shall be determined as follows:
1.A pupil who is enrolled full-time in Arizona
online instruction shall be funded for online instruction at ninetyfive
percent of the base support level that would be calculated for that pupil if
that pupil were enrolled as a fulltime student in a school district or
charter school that does not participate in Arizona online
instruction.Charter additional assistance and district additional
assistance shall be calculated in the same manner they would be calculated if
the student were enrolled in a district or charter school that does not
participate in Arizona online instruction.
2.A pupil who is enrolled part-time in Arizona
online instruction shall be funded for online instruction at eightyfive
percent of the base support level that would be calculated for that pupil if

charter school that does not participate in Arizona online
instruction.Charter additional assistance and district additional
assistance shall be calculated in the same manner they would be calculated if
the student were enrolled in a district or charter school that does not participate
in Arizona online instruction.
G.If the academic achievement of a pupil declines
while the pupil is participating in Arizona online instruction, the pupil's
parents, the pupil's teachers and the principal or head teacher of the school
shall confer to evaluate whether the pupil should be allowed to continue to
participate in Arizona online instruction.
H.The
department of education shall review all online course content for adherence to
state standards for those courses that have state standards and shall issue a
recommendation for approval or denial to the state board of education or the
state board for charter schools, as appropriate, for action.
H.I.To ensure the
academic integrity of pupils who participate in online instruction, Arizona online
instruction shall include multiple diverse assessment measures and the
proctored administration of required state standardized tests. The final examination for each online course shall be
designed to demonstrate competency in that subject and shall be monitored by a
representative of the school who is physically in the same room with the pupil
during the entire final examination.

school may not charge a fee to a pupil who takes an examination in a particular
