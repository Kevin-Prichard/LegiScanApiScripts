(TEXT OF BILL BEGINS ON NEXT PAGE)





Whereas, the brave men
and women of the armed forces of the United States who proudly serve our nation
and risk their lives to protect our freedom deserve the investment of every
possible resource to ensure their lasting physical, mental and emotional
well-being; and
Whereas, for many of
our veterans the challenges of serving in combat do not stop when they return
home; and
Whereas, the diagnosis
now known as post-traumatic stress disorder was first defined to commonly and
more accurately understand and treat veterans who had endured severe traumatic
combat stress; and
Whereas, combat operational
stress has historically been viewed as a mental illness caused by a preexisting
flaw of character or ability, and the term "post-traumatic stress
disorder" carries a stigma that perpetuates this misconception; and
Whereas,
post-traumatic stress can occur not only after a traumatic event experienced in
combat, but also after rape, sexual assault, battery, torture, confinement,
child abuse, car accidents, train wrecks, plane crashes, bombings or natural
disasters; and
Whereas,
post-traumatic stress is a very common injury to the brain that is treatable
and repairable; and
Whereas, referring to
the complications resulting from post-traumatic stress as disorders perpetuates
the stigma of and bias against mental illness, and the stigma discourages those
suffering from post-traumatic stress from seeking proper and timely medical
treatment; and
Whereas, making the
condition less stigmatizing and more honorable can favorably influence those
affected and encourage them to seek help without fear of retribution or shame;
and
Whereas, proper and
timely treatment can diminish suicide rates that are attributable to
post-traumatic stress; and
Whereas, all citizens
suffering from post-traumatic stress injury deserve our consideration, and
those who have received these wounds in service to our nation further deserve
our greatest respect and recognition.
Therefore
Be it resolved by the House of Representatives of the State of
Arizona, the Senate concurring:
That the Members
of the Legislature proclaim June 27, 2016 as PostTraumatic Stress Injury
Awareness Day in Arizona.
