Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Arizona:
Section1.Section 42-1125, Arizona Revised
Statutes, is amended to read:
START_STATUTE42-1125.Civil penalties; definition
A.If a taxpayer fails to make and file a return for
a tax administered pursuant to this article on or before the due date of the
return or the due date as extended by the department, unless it is shown that
the failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to wilful neglect, four and
onehalf percent of the tax required to be shown on such return shall be
added to the tax for each month or fraction of a month elapsing between the due
date of the return and the date on which it is filed.The total
penalty shall not exceed twentyfive percent of the tax found to be
remaining due. The penalty so added to the tax is due and payable on notice
and demand from the department.For the purpose of computing the
penalty imposed under this subsection, the amount required to be shown as tax
on a return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax which that is paid on or before the beginning of
such month and by the amount of any credit against the tax which that
may be claimed on the return.If the amount required to be shown as
tax on a return is less than the amount shown as tax on such return, the penalty
described in this subsection shall be applied by substituting such lower
amount.
B.If a taxpayer fails or refuses to file a return
on notice and demand by the department, the taxpayer shall pay a penalty of
twentyfive percent of the tax, which is due and payable on notice and
demand by the department, in addition to any penalty prescribed by subsection A
of this section, unless it is shown that the failure is due to reasonable cause
and not due to wilful neglect.This penalty is payable on notice and
demand from the department.
C.If a taxpayer fails or refuses to furnish any
information requested in writing by the department, the department may add a
penalty of twentyfive percent of the amount of any deficiency tax
assessed by the department concerning the assessment of which the information
was required, unless it is shown that the failure is due to reasonable cause
and not due to wilful neglect.
D.If a person fails to pay the amount shown as tax
on any return within the time prescribed, a penalty of onehalf of one
percent, not to exceed a total of ten percent, shall be added to the amount
shown as tax for each month or fraction of a month during which the failure
continues, unless it is shown that the failure is due to reasonable cause and
not due to wilful neglect. If the department determines that the person's
failure to pay was due to reasonable cause and not due to wilful neglect and
that a payment agreement pursuant to section 422057 is appropriate, the
department shall not impose the penalty unless the taxpayer fails to comply
with the payment agreement. If the taxpayer is also subject to a penalty under
subsection A of this section for the same tax period, the total penalties under
subsection A of this section and this subsection shall not exceed twentyfive
percent.For the purpose of computing the penalty imposed under this
subsection:
1.The amount shown as tax on a return shall be
reduced by the amount of any part of the tax that is paid on or before the
beginning of that month and by the amount of any credit against the tax that
may be claimed on the return.
2.If the amount shown as tax on a return is greater
than the amount required to be shown as tax on that return, the penalty shall
be applied by substituting the lower amount.
E.If a person fails to pay any amount required to
be shown on any return that is not so shown within twentyone calendar
days after the date of notice and demand, a penalty of onehalf of one
percent, not to exceed a total of ten percent, shall be added to the amount of
tax for each month or fraction of a month during which the failure continues,
unless it is shown that the failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to
wilful neglect. If the taxpayer is also subject to penalty under subsection A
of this section for the same tax period, the total penalties under subsection A
of this section and this subsection shall not exceed twentyfive
percent.For the purpose of computing the penalty imposed under this
subsection, any amount required to be shown on any return shall be reduced by
the amount of any part of the tax that is paid on or before the beginning of
that month and by the amount of any credit against the tax that may be claimed
on the return.
F.In the case of a deficiency, for which a
determination is made of an additional amount due, which that
is due to negligence but without intent to defraud, the person shall pay a
penalty of ten percent of the amount of the deficiency.
G.If part of a deficiency is due to fraud with
intent to evade tax, fifty percent of the total amount of the tax, in addition
to the deficiency, interest and other penalties provided in this section, shall
be assessed, collected and paid as if it were a deficiency.
H.If the amount, whether determined by the
department or the taxpayer, required to be withheld by the employer pursuant to
title 43, chapter 4 is not paid to the department on or before the date
prescribed for its remittance, the department may add a penalty of twentyfive
percent of the amount required to be withheld and paid, unless it is shown that
the failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to wilful neglect.
I.A person who, with or without intent to evade any
requirement of this article or any lawful administrative rule of the department
of revenue under this article, fails to file a return or to supply information
required under this article or who, with or without such intent, makes,
prepares, renders, signs or verifies a false or fraudulent return or statement
or supplies false or fraudulent information shall pay a penalty of not more
than one thousand dollars.This penalty shall be recovered by the
department of law in the name of this state by an action in any court of competent
jurisdiction.
J.If the taxpayer files what purports to be a
return of any tax administered pursuant to this article but that is frivolous
or that is made with the intent to delay or impede the administration of the
tax laws, that person shall pay a penalty of five hundred dollars.
K.If any person who is required to file or provide
an information return under this title or title 43 or who is required to file
or provide a return or report under chapter 3 of this title fails to file the
return or report at the prescribed time or in the manner required, or files a
return or report that fails to show the information required, that person shall
pay a penalty of one hundred dollars for each month or fraction of a month
during which the failure continues unless it is shown that the failure is due
to reasonable cause and not due to wilful neglect. The total penalties for
each return or report under this subsection shall not exceed five hundred
dollars.
L.If it appears to the superior court that
proceedings before it have been instituted or maintained by a taxpayer
primarily for delay or that the taxpayer's position is frivolous or groundless,
the court may award damages in an amount not to exceed one thousand dollars to
this state.Damages so awarded shall be collected as a part of the
tax.
M.A person who is required under section 43413
to furnish a statement to an employee and who wilfully furnishes a false or
fraudulent statement, or who wilfully fails to furnish a statement required by
section 43413, is for each such failure subject to a penalty of fifty
dollars.
N.A person who is required to collect or truthfully
account for and pay a tax administered pursuant to this article, including any
luxury privilege tax, and who wilfully fails to collect the tax or truthfully
account for and pay the tax, or wilfully attempts in any manner to evade or
defeat the tax or its payment, is, in addition to other penalties provided by
law, liable for a penalty equal to the total amount of the tax evaded, not collected
or not accounted for and paid. Except as provided in subsections U, V and W of
this section, no other penalty under this section relating to failure to pay
tax may be imposed for any offense to which this subsection applies.

make payment by electronic funds transfer fails to do so, that taxpayer shall
pay a penalty of five percent of the amount of the payment not made by electronic
funds transfer unless it is shown that the failure is due to reasonable cause
and not due to wilful neglect. For the reporting periods beginning on July 1,
2015, the penalty in this subsection applies to any taxpayer who is required
under section 423053 to make payment by electronic funds transfer and
fails to do so unless it is shown that the failure is due to reasonable cause
and not due to wilful neglect.
P.Unless due to
reasonable cause and not to wilful neglect:

to provide that person's taxpayer identification number in any return,
statement or other document as required by section 421105, subsection A
shall pay a penalty of five dollars for each such failure.

other document without compensation on behalf of a taxpayer, who fails to
include that person's own taxpayer identification number and the taxpayer's

violation is failure to provide taxpayer identification numbers.
Q.If a taxpayer fails to pay the full amount of
estimated tax required by title 43, chapter 5, article 6, a penalty is assessed
equal to the amount of interest that would otherwise accrue under section 421123

of the amount not paid.The penalty prescribed by this subsection is
in lieu of any other penalty otherwise prescribed by this section and in lieu
of interest prescribed by section 421123.

as prescribed in section 425005, subsection D, a civil penalty of up to
twenty-five dollars shall be added to the renewal fee for each jurisdiction.
S.The department of law, with the consent of the
department of revenue, may compromise any penalty for which it may bring an
action under this section.
T.Penalties shall not be assessed under subsection
