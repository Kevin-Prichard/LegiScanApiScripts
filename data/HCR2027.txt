A CONCURRENT RESOLUTION

proclaiming February 5, 2016 as National Wear Red Day in
Arizona.

(TEXT OF BILL BEGINS ON NEXT PAGE)





Whereas, heart disease
and strokes kill one in three women in the United States, yet 80% of cardiac
events are preventable; and
Whereas,
cardiovascular diseases and strokes kill one woman every 80 seconds in the
United States; and
Whereas, an estimated
44 million women in the United States are affected by cardiovascular diseases;
and
Whereas, 90% of women
have one or more risk factors for developing heart disease, yet only one in
five American women believes that heart disease is her greatest health threat;
and
Whereas, women comprise
only 24% of participants in all heart-related studies; and
Whereas, women are
less likely to call 911 for themselves when experiencing symptoms of a heart
attack than they are if someone else were having a heart attack; and
Whereas, only 36% of
AfricanAmerican women and 34% of Hispanic women know that heart disease
is their greatest health risk, as compared with 65% of Caucasian women; and
Whereas, women
involved with the American Heart Association's Go Red For Women movement live
healthier lives, and nearly 90% of these women have made at least one healthy
behavioral change; and
Whereas, Go Red For
Women encourages women to take charge of their health and schedule a well-woman
visit to learn about their health status and risk for diseases; and
Whereas, Go Red For
Women asks all Americans to "Go Red" by wearing red on February 5,
2016 and to do the following:
1.Get
their numbers by asking their doctors to check their blood pressure,
cholesterol and glucose.
2.Own
their lifestyle by stopping smoking, losing weight, being physically active and
eating healthy.
3.Raise
their voices by advocating for more women-related research and education.
4.Educate
their families by making healthy food choices for themselves and their families
and teaching their children the importance of staying active.
5.Donate
their time or money to organizations supporting womenrelated research
and education.
Therefore
Be it resolved by the House of Representatives of the State of
Arizona, the Senate concurring:
1.That the Members of the Legislature proclaim
February 5, 2016 as National Wear Red Day in Arizona.
2.That the Members of the Legislature recognize
that thousands of lives can be saved each year by increasing awareness about
heart disease and empowering women to reduce their risk for cardiovascular
disease.
3.That the Members of the Legislature encourage
citizens to show their support for women and the fight against heart disease by
wearing the color red in honor of National Wear Red Day in Arizona.
