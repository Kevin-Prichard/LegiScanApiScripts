(TEXT OF BILL BEGINS ON NEXT PAGE)





To the Congress of the United States of America:
Your memorialist respectfully represents:
Whereas, United Nations (UN) Security Council Resolution 2117,
which was adopted on September 26, 2013, "[c]alls for Member States to
support weapons collection, disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of excombatants,
as well as physical security and stockpile management programmes by United
Nations peacekeeping operations where so mandated"; and
Whereas, the UN Arms Trade Treaty strives to place a global ban
on the import and export of small firearms, affecting all private gun owners in
the United States, and to implement an international gun registry on all
private guns and ammunition; and
Whereas, Senator James Inhofe introduced an amendment to the
budget in 2013 that would prevent the United States from entering into the
United Nations Arms Trade Treaty "[t]o uphold Second Amendment rights and
prevent the United States from entering into the United Nations Arms Trade
Treaty," which passed on a 53-46 vote.
Wherefore your
memorialist, the Senate of the State of Arizona, the House of Representatives concurring,
prays:
1.That the United
States Congress continue to take action to prevent the United States from
entering into the UN Arms Trade Treaty or other similar treaties that would
interfere with the Second Amendment rights of United States citizens.
2.That the Secretary of
State of the State of Arizona transmit copies of this Memorial to the President
of the United States, the Speaker of the United States House of
Representatives, the President of the United States Senate and each Member of
Congress from the State of Arizona.
