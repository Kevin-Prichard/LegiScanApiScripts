convert a portion of the unused balance of the tax credit, at the taxpayer's
option either:

the transaction privilege tax burden with respect to contracts for the
construction of fixed capital assets in this state that are owned by the
taxpayer.
2.Into cash
reimbursements for infrastructure improvements and other capital expenditures
associated with projects in this state.
B.The
amount of the tax credit that may be converted under this section is
eighty-five percent of the amount requested for conversion.The
taxpayer waives the remaining fifteen percent of the unused amount of the tax
credits requested on approval of the conversion.
C.To be
eligible for the conversion of unused income tax credits under this section,
the taxpayer must make new capital investment or create or retain employment in
this state after December 31, 2016 as follows:
1.The
investment requirement for fixed capital assets must equal at least _________
million dollars.
2.The
employment requirement must involve the creation or retention of at least _________
employment positions at the location or locations of the capital investment to
which all of the following apply:
(a)Each employment position
consists of at least one thousand seven hundred fifty hours per year of
full-time permanent employment.
(b)The job duties are performed
primarily at the location or locations of the capital investment.
(c)The employer pays compensation
at least equal to the median wage by county as computed annually by the
authority.
D.The
taxpayer must apply to the authority for conversion of tax credits in a form
that is prescribed by the authority and that includes all of the following
information:
1.The

unused balance rolls over to add to the conversion capacity of the following
year.

Sec.2.Section 42-1118, Arizona Revised
Statutes, is amended to read:
START_STATUTE42-1118.Refunds, credits, offsets and abatements
A.If the department determines that any amount of
tax, penalty or interest has been paid in excess of the amount actually due,
the department shall credit the excess amount against any tax administered
pursuant to this article, including any penalty, interest or other amounts owed
by the taxpayer to the department.If it is determined that the
amount cannot be credited against a tax or installment of taxes due from the
taxpayer, the department may:
1.Refund the entire amount of tax, interest and
penalty, in a lump sum or in not more than five annual installments, to the
taxpayer from whom it was collected.
2.Issue to the taxpayer a credit voucher for the
entire amount of tax, interest and penalty collected, to be carried forward and
applied against future tax liabilities until exhausted.
3.Refund part, and issue a credit voucher for the
balance, of the tax, interest and penalties as provided in paragraphs 1 and 2
of this subsection.
B.If the total amount withheld from income under
section 43401 exceeds the amount of the tax on the employee's entire
taxable income as computed under title 43, the department shall refund the
amount of the excess deducted without requiring a filing of a refund claim as
provided in this section. The failure of the department to make the refund
does not limit the right of the taxpayer to file a claim for a refund pursuant
to this section if the claim is not barred under section 421106.The
department shall not refund amounts less than one dollar unless specifically
requested by the taxpayer at the time the return or claim for refund is filed.
C.Any overpayment that may result from withholdings
or estimates pursuant to section 43401, 43581 or 43582
shall not be credited or refunded unless an Arizona income tax return has been
filed for the tax year for which the withholdings or estimates were made.
D.The department shall give a vendor who has a duty
to collect use tax pursuant to chapter 5, article 4 of this title and who has
not collected that tax full credit or offset for any use tax, interest and
penalty paid to the department by the purchaser when issuing a determination of
a deficiency pursuant to section 421108.This credit or
offset shall be computed from the date of the use tax payment by the
purchaser.If the purchaser has been audited by the department for
use tax for the period of the purchase, the purchaser is considered to have
paid the use tax to the department.For other purchases, the vendor
may submit an affirmation by a purchaser on a form prescribed by the department
that use tax was paid on the purchase.A fully completed
certificate, taken in good faith by the vendor, constitutes proof that the
vendor is entitled to this credit or offset.The department may
require a purchaser who has submitted the certificate to establish the accuracy
and completeness of the information contained in the certificate. If the
purchaser cannot establish the accuracy and completeness of the information,
the purchaser is liable for a penalty equal to the amount of tax and interest
that would have been paid by the seller and for the additional penalties
pursuant to section 421125.Payment of the penalty relieves
the purchaser of any responsibility for paying the use tax.The
department may require this proof and may assess the purchaser within the later
of the period of limitations set forth in section 421104 or one year
from the date the notice of proposed deficiency is issued to the vendor if the
purchaser does not establish the accuracy of the information contained in the
certificate.
E.Each claim for refund shall be filed with the
department in writing and shall identify the claimant by name, address and tax
identification number.Each claim shall provide the amount of refund
requested, the specific tax period involved and the specific grounds on which
the claim is founded.Refunds are subject to setoff for debts
pursuant to section 421122.
F.A motor vehicle manufacturer that repurchases a
vehicle pursuant to section 441263 or for reasons of consumer
satisfaction may apply for a refund of the taxes paid under chapter 5 of this
title if that manufacturer has refunded the amount of tax to the consumer. A
refund is allowed under this subsection only if the manufacturer provides
satisfactory proof to the department that tax amounts attributed to the sale of
the vehicle were collected from the consumer and that the manufacturer refunded
an amount of tax to the consumer. Any refund provided under this subsection is
in lieu of any refund on the vehicle that the dealer may otherwise be entitled
to receive. A manufacturer must apply for a refund under this subsection
within four years after repurchasing the vehicle.For the purposes
of this subsection:
1."Consumer" has the same meaning
prescribed in section 441261.
2."Motor vehicle manufacturer" means a
corporation engaged in the business of producing passenger cars, trucks and
multipurpose passenger vehicles as described in 49 Code of Federal Regulations
section 571.3.
3."Satisfactory proof" includes copies of
checks and a purchase or lease agreement that lists the vehicle identification
number and that itemizes the amount that was collected as tax from the
consumer.
g.A
taxpayer who has an income tax credit for increased research activities under
section 43-1074.01 or 43-1168 and who meets prescribed capital investment or
employment thresholds may convert eighty-five percent of the outstanding income
tax credit carryforward toward a refund of amounts paid by the taxpayer for
transaction privilege taxes imposed pursuant to section 42-5075 with respect to
construction contracts associated with the capital investment or into cash
reimbursements for infrastructure improvements and other capital expenditures
associated with projects in this state.The taxpayer must submit a
claim for refund to the department as provided by this section, including a
certificate of conversion issued by the Arizona commerce authority to the
taxpayer pursuant to section 411507.02. On confirming the validity of
the claim, the department shall pay the entire amount as a lump sum.
G.H.The department
shall not imprint the full social security number or other taxpayer identifier
used pursuant to section 421105 on any taxpayer refund check, voucher or
other credit documentation issued to the taxpayer under this section.
H.I.If any amount has
been erroneously determined to be due from any person but not yet collected,
the department shall cancel the amount or amounts on its records.
I.J.If, with or after
the filing of a protest or an appeal with the department, the state board of
tax appeals or the court, a taxpayer pays the tax protested or appealed before
the department, board or court acts upon on the protest or the appeal,
such body shall treat the protest or the appeal as a claim for refund or an
appeal from the denial of a claim for refund filed under this section. END_STATUTE

commerce authority pursuant to section 411507.01.The
additional credit amount under this subdivision shall not exceed the amount
allowed based on actual basic research payments or the department's
certification, whichever is less.If an application, if certified in
full, would exceed the ten million dollar limit, the department shall certify
only an amount within that limit.After the limit is attained, the
department shall deny any subsequent applications regardless of whether other
certified amounts are not actually claimed as a credit or other taxpayers fail
to qualify to actually claim certified amounts. Notwithstanding subsections B

subdivision that exceeds the taxes otherwise due under this title is not
refundable, but may be carried forward to the next five consecutive taxable
