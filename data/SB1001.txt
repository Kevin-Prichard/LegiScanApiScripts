Sec.2.Legislative intent
The legislature finds that the proliferation of license plates
with completely dissimilar designs in this state creates confusion for law
enforcement and for witnesses to crimes. Some special license plates are very
colorful and difficult to read. It is the intent of the legislature to assist
the public and law enforcement to easily read and recognize license plates as
license plates that are issued by this state.
