A.A retired member who is engaged to work by an

retirement benefits received by the member from the date ASRS notifies the
member in writing that the member's employment resulted in active membership in

section 38760, with the same beneficiary, if applicable, as when the
member first retired, unless the member has resumed active membership for at
least sixty consecutive months. A member who retired under a provision of law
allowing increased benefits if the retirement occurred during a specific period
of time and who subsequently becomes an employee under ASRS shall not retain
the increased benefits under the prior law when benefits are computed for the
member's most recent retirement.

F.Section 38769, subsection L applies when
determining the maximum benefit that may be paid to a retired member who
resumes active membership and subsequently retires.

Statutes, is amended to read:
START_STATUTE38-849.Limitations on receiving pension; violation;
classification; reemployment after severance; reinstatement of service credits;
reemployment of retired member or member with a disability; definition
A.If a member is convicted of, or discharged
because of, theft, embezzlement, fraud or misappropriation of an employer's
property or property under the control of the employer, the member shall be
subject to restitution and fines imposed by a court of competent jurisdiction.
The court may order the restitution or fines to be paid from any payments
otherwise payable to the member from the retirement system.
B.A person who knowingly makes any false statement
or who falsifies or permits to be falsified any record of the system with an
intent to defraud the system is guilty of a class 5 felony.If any
change or error in the records results in any member or beneficiary receiving
from the system more or less than the member or beneficiary would have been
entitled to receive had the records been correct, the local board shall correct
such error, and as far as practicable shall adjust the payments in such manner
that the actuarial equivalent of the benefit to which such member or
beneficiary was correctly entitled shall be paid.If a member is
convicted of a crime specified in this subsection, section 13713
applies.
C.If a member who received a severance refund on
termination of employment pursuant to section 38846.02 becomes
reemployed with the same employer within two years after the former member's
termination date, the member may have forfeited credited service attributable
to service rendered during a prior period of service as an employee restored on
satisfaction of each of the following conditions:

application for reinstatement of forfeited credited service within ninety days
after again becoming an employee.
2.The retirement fund is paid the total amount
previously withdrawn pursuant to section 38846.02 plus compound interest
from the date of withdrawal to the date of repayment. Interest shall be
computed at the rate of nine per cent
percent for each year
compounded each year from the date of withdrawal to the date of repayment.
Forfeited credited service shall not be restored until complete payment is

shall be cancelled and service shall be credited only from the date the
member's most recent reemployment period commenced.However, a
present active member of the system who forfeited credited service, received a
severance refund pursuant to section 38846.02 and becomes reemployed
with the same employer two years or more after the member's termination date or
becomes reemployed with another employer may elect to redeem any part of that
forfeited credited service by paying into the system any amounts required
pursuant to this subsection.A present active member who elects to
redeem any part of forfeited credited service for which the member is deemed
eligible by the board shall pay into the system the amounts previously paid or
transferred to the member as a severance refund plus an amount, computed by the
system's actuary that is necessary to equal the increase in the actuarial
present value of projected benefits resulting from the redemption calculated
using the actuarial methods and assumptions prescribed by the system's
actuary. On satisfaction of this obligation the member's prior service credits
shall be reinstated.

rules, employee contributions shall not be made on the retired member's
account, and any service shall not be credited during the period of
reemployment.The employer shall not pay the alternate contribution
rate pursuant to section 38843.05.

E, F, G,
or H or I of this section applies.
J.K.The
local board shall review all reemployment determinations and voluntary
assignments as described in subsection F g of this section. If the
local board or the system is not provided the necessary information required by
the system to make a reemployment determination, the local board and the system
shall suspend pension payments until information is received and a
determination is made regarding whether the reemployment meets the requirements
of subsection E, F, G, H, or I or
J of this section. 
K.L.A
person who defrauds the system or who takes, converts, steals or embezzles
monies owned by or from the system and who fails or refuses to return the
monies to the system on the board's written request is subject to civil suit by

finding the person has defrauded the system or taken, converted, stolen or
embezzled monies owned by or from the system, the court shall enter an order
against that person and for the system awarding the system all of its costs and

amounts awarded to the system, plus interest at the rate prescribed by section
441201, until all amounts owed are paid to the system.

any other provision of this article, the board may offset against any benefits
otherwise payable by the system to an active or retired member or survivor any
court ordered amounts awarded to the board and system and assessed against the
member or survivor.

subsection does not affect or impair the right of an employer to prescribe
medical or physical standards for employees or prospective employees.
C.If a member who becomes a member of the plan
before January 1, 2012 ceases to be an employee for any reason other than death
or retirement, within twenty days after filing a completed application with the
board, the member is entitled to receive the following amounts, less any
benefit payments the member has received and any amount the member may owe to
the plan:

eligible rollover distribution and the member elects to have the distribution
paid directly to an eligible retirement plan or individual retirement account
or annuity and specifies the eligible retirement plan or individual retirement
account or annuity to which the distribution is to be paid, the distribution
shall be made in the form of a direct trusteetotrustee transfer
to the specified eligible retirement plan.The distribution shall be
made in the form and at the time prescribed by the board.
G.For distributions occurring from and after
December 31, 2007, a member or a member's beneficiary, including a nonspouse
designated beneficiary to the extent permitted under subsection H of this
section, may roll over an eligible rollover distribution as defined in section
402(c)(4) of the internal revenue code to a Roth individual retirement account,
if, for distributions occurring before January 1, 2010, the member or the
member's beneficiary satisfies the requirements for making a Roth individual
retirement account contribution under section 408A(c)(3)(B) of the internal
revenue code, as in effect on the date of the rollover. Any amount rolled over
to a Roth individual retirement account is included in the gross income of the
member or the member's beneficiary to the extent the amounts would have been
included in gross income if not rolled over as required under section
408A(d)(3)(A) of the internal revenue code. For the purposes of this
subsection, the administrator is not responsible for ensuring the member or the
member's beneficiary is eligible to make a rollover to a Roth individual
retirement account.
H.For distributions made from and after December
31, 2009, a nonspouse designated beneficiary as defined in section 401(a)(9)(E)
of the internal revenue code may elect to directly roll over an eligible
rollover distribution to an individual retirement account under section 408(a)
of the internal revenue code or an individual retirement annuity under section
408(b) of the internal revenue code that is established on behalf of the
designated beneficiary and that will be treated as an inherited individual
retirement plan pursuant to section 402(c)(11) of the internal revenue code. In
order to be able to roll over the distribution, the distribution otherwise must
satisfy the definition of an eligible rollover distribution as defined in
section 402(c)(4) of the internal revenue code.In applying this
subsection, a nonspouse rollover is not subject to the direct rollover
requirements under section 401(a)(31) of the internal revenue code, the
rollover notice requirements under section 402(f) of the internal revenue code
or the mandatory withholding requirements under section 3405(c) of the internal
revenue code.
I.For plan years occurring before January 1, 2007,
the period for providing the rollover notice as required under section 402(f)
of the internal revenue code is no less than thirty days and no more than
ninety days before the date of distribution and, for plan years beginning from
and after December 31, 2006, the period for providing the rollover notice as
required under section 402(f) of the internal revenue code is no less than
thirty days and no more than one hundred eighty days before the date of
distribution.
J.Service shall be credited to a member's
individual credited service account in accordance with rules the local board
prescribes.In no case shall more than twelve months of credited
service be credited on account of all service rendered by a member in any one
year.In no case shall service be credited for any period during
which the member is not employed in a designated position, except as provided
by sections 38921 and 38922.
K.Credited service is forfeited if the amounts
prescribed in subsection C, D or E of this section are paid or are transferred
in accordance with this section.
L.If a former member becomes reemployed with the
same employer within two years after the former member's termination date, a
member may have forfeited credited service attributable to service rendered
during a prior period of service as an employee restored on satisfaction of
each of the following conditions:
1.The member files
with the plan a written application for reinstatement of forfeited credited
service within ninety days after again becoming an employee.
2.The retirement fund is paid the total amount
previously withdrawn pursuant to subsection C, D or E of this section plus
compound interest from the date of withdrawal to the dates of repayment.
Interest shall be computed at the rate of nine percent for each year compounded
each year from the date of withdrawal to the date of repayment. Forfeited
credited service shall not be restored until complete payment is received by
the fund.
3.The required payment is completed within one year
after returning to employee status.
M.If a member who receives a severance refund on
termination of employment pursuant to subsection C, D or E of this section is
subsequently reemployed by an employer, the member's prior service credits are
cancelled, and the board shall credit service only from the date the member's
most recent reemployment period commenced. However, a present active member of
the plan who received a refund of accumulated contributions from the plan
pursuant to subsection C, D or E of this section, forfeited credited service
pursuant to subsection K of this section and becomes reemployed with the same
employer two years or more after the member's termination date or becomes
reemployed with another employer may elect to redeem any part of that forfeited
credited service by paying into the plan any amounts required pursuant to this
subsection.A present active member who elects to redeem any part of
forfeited credited service for which the member is deemed eligible by the board
shall pay into the plan the amounts previously paid or transferred as a refund
of the member's accumulated contributions plus an amount, computed by the
plan's actuary that is necessary to equal the increase in the actuarial present
value of projected benefits resulting from the redemption calculated using the
actuarial methods and assumptions prescribed by the plan's actuary. On
satisfaction of this obligation, the board shall reinstate the member's prior
service credits.
N.A retired member may become employed by an
employer in a designated position and continue to receive a pension if the
employment occurs at least twelve months after retirement. The retired member
shall not contribute to the fund and shall not accrue credited service. If a
retired member becomes employed by an employer in a designated position before
twelve months after retirement:
1.Payment of the retired member's pension shall be
suspended until the retired member again ceases to be an
employee.The amount of pension shall not be changed on account of
service as an employee subsequent to retirement.
2.The retired member shall not contribute to the
fund and shall not accrue credited service.
O.An
employer may not contract with or lease a retired member within twelve months
after the member's retirement date.END_STATUTE
