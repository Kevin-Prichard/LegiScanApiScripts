A concurrent resolution

recognizing the
rights of family members, caregivers and guardians of individuals with a
serious mental illness.


(TEXT OF BILL BEGINS ON NEXT PAGE)





Whereas, family members, caregivers
and guardians of an individual with a serious mental illness are recognized as
being an integral part of that individual's treatment team; and
Whereas, federal and state laws allow many routine and often
critical communications between behavioral health care providers and a
patient's family members, caregivers and guardians; and
Whereas, current rules, policies and practices among behavioral
health care providers fail to consider the critical role played by actively
involved family members, caregivers and guardians in the effective treatment,
care and supervision of individuals with a serious mental illness; and
Whereas, family members, caregivers and guardians are often
excluded from decision making due to the misinterpretation of federal patient
privacy laws, resulting in a lack of family engagement in patient intake and
treatment decisions and discharge planning; and
Whereas, it is in the best interests of individuals with a
serious mental illness for their behavioral health care providers to have
access to any critical medical information and history known to family members,
caregivers and guardians as this knowledge will enhance treatment; and
Whereas, existing federal and state laws allow for family
members, caregivers and guardians of an individual with a serious mental
illness to share critical medical information and history with that
individual's behavioral health care providers; and
Whereas, it is not in the best interests of an individual with
a serious mental illness to be discharged to a family member, caregiver or
guardian without first equipping that family member, caregiver or guardian with
sufficient information and resources to provide adequate supportive and ongoing
care.
Therefore
Be it resolved by
the Senate of the State of Arizona, the House of Representatives concurring:
1.That the Members of the Legislature recognize
that family members, caregivers and guardians of an individual with a serious
mental illness have the right to communicate with all providers of behavioral
health care services for that individual.
2.That the Members of the Legislature recognize
that family members, caregivers and guardians of an individual with a serious
mental illness have the right to be treated with respect and compassion when
seeking the appropriate treatment and care for that individual.
3.That the Members of the Legislature recognize
that it is essential for the treatment team of an individual with a serious
mental illness to make every effort to establish a complete medical history
that includes information received from family members, caregivers and
guardians and to actively include family members, caregivers and guardians in
treatment planning.
4.That the Members of the Legislature recognize
that family members, caregivers and guardians of an individual with a serious
mental illness have the right to receive access to approved information during
discharge planning if there is an executed release of information on file or if
a valid guardianship is in place.
5.That the Members of the Legislature recognize
that family members, caregivers and guardians of an individual with a serious
mental illness should receive information that will enable them to effectively
evaluate the safety and security of their homes on discharge of that individual
into their care.
6.That the Members of the Legislature recognize
that family members, caregivers and guardians of an individual with a serious
mental illness have the right to expect to receive information relating to
support services available in the community at all levels of service, including
family support, education, counseling and grief counseling.
7.That the Members of the Legislature recognize
that family members, caregivers and guardians of an individual with a serious
mental illness have the right to file a grievance, complaint or concern without
fear of retaliation and to expect to receive information regarding the process
of such filings.
