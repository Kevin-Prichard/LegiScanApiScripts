Statutes, is amended to read:
START_STATUTE12-2602.Preliminary expert opinion testimony; certification;
qualification criteria
A.If a claim against a licensed professional is
asserted in a civil action or
arbitration, the claimant
or the claimant's attorney
shall certify in a written statement that is filed and served with the claim
whether or not expert opinion testimony is necessary to prove the licensed
professional's standard of care or liability for the claim.
B.If the claimant or the claimant's attorney
certifies pursuant to subsection A of
this section that expert opinion testimony is necessary, the
claimant shall serve a preliminary expert opinion affidavit with the initial
disclosures that are required by rule 26.1, Arizona rules of civil procedure, or as an interim measure or prehearing
exchange and production of information that is required by the arbitration
tribunal before the arbitration hearing.The claimant
may provide affidavits from as many experts as the claimant deems
necessary.The preliminary expert opinion affidavit shall contain at
least the following information:
1.The expert's qualifications to express an opinion
on the licensed professional's standard of care or liability for the claim.
2.The factual basis for each claim against a
licensed professional.
3.The licensed professional's acts, errors or
omissions that the expert considers to be a violation of the applicable
standard of care resulting in liability.
4.The manner in which the licensed professional's
acts, errors or omissions caused or contributed to the damages or other relief
sought by the claimant.
C.The court or
arbitrator may extend the time for compliance with this section
on application and good cause shown or by stipulation of the parties to the
claim.If the court or
arbitrator extends the time for compliance, the court or arbitrator may also adjust
the timing and sequence of disclosures that are required from the licensed
professional against whom the claim is asserted.
D.If the claimant or the claimant's attorney
certifies that expert testimony is not required for its claim and the licensed
professional who is defending the claim disputes that certification in good faith,
the licensed professional may apply by motion to the court or arbitrator for an order requiring the
claimant to obtain and serve a preliminary expert opinion affidavit under this
section.In its motion, the licensed professional shall identify the
following:
1.The claim for which it believes expert testimony
is needed.
2.The prima facie elements of the claim.
3.The legal or factual basis for its contention
that expert opinion testimony is required to establish the standard of care or
liability for the claim.
E.After considering the motion and any response,
the court or arbitrator
shall determine whether the claimant shall comply with this section and, if the
court or arbitrator deems
that compliance is necessary, shall set a date and terms for
compliance.The court or
arbitrator shall stay all other proceedings and applicable time
periods concerning the claim pending the court's or arbitrator's ruling on the motion to compel
compliance with this section.
F.The court
or arbitrator, on its own motion or the motion of the licensed
professional, shall dismiss the claim against the licensed professional without
prejudice if the claimant fails to file and serve a preliminary expert opinion
affidavit after the claimant or the claimant's attorney has certified that an affidavit is
necessary or the court or arbitrator has
ordered the claimant to file and serve an affidavit.
G.A claimant may supplement a claim or preliminary
expert opinion affidavit with additional claims, evidence or expert opinions that
are timely disclosed under the Arizona rules of civil procedure, arbitration tribunal rules or pursuant to a court or arbitration tribunal order.An
action under this chapter does not preclude a party from using a preliminary
expert opinion affidavit for any purpose, including impeachment.
H.An expert
witness's opinion or testimony on the appropriate standard of practice or care
of a licensed professional does not satisfy the requirements of this section
unless the expert witness who provides the opinion or testimony is licensed or
registered in this state or another state and the expert witness meets the
following criteria:
1.If the
licensed professional against whom the expert opinion or testimony is offered
is, or claims to be, registered or licensed in a particular profession or
occupation or in a designated branch, license category or proficiency of a
profession or occupation, the expert witness must be registered or licensed in
the same profession or occupation or designated branch, license category or
proficiency.
2.During
the year immediately preceding the occurrence giving rise to the claim, the
expert must have devoted a majority of the expert's professional work or
practice to either or both of the following:

occupation or designated branch, license category or proficiency of the
profession or occupation as the licensed professional against whom the expert
opinion or testimony is offered.

designated branch, license category or proficiency of the profession or
occupation as the licensed professional against whom the expert opinion or
testimony is offered.
I.If the
licensed professional is a firm that employs a licensed professional against
whom the expert opinion or testimony is offered, subsection H of this section
applies as if the licensed professional were the party against whom the expert
opinion or testimony is offered.
J.This
section does not limit the power of the trial court or arbitrator to disqualify
an expert witness on grounds other than the qualifications required by this
section.
K.An expert
witness in a claim may not testify if the fee of the witness is in any way
contingent on the outcome of the claim. END_STATUTE
