A CONCURRENT RESOLUTION

EXPRESSING support for Arizona's Latina-owned businesses.


(TEXT OF BILL BEGINS ON NEXT PAGE)





Whereas, according to
a 2015 report by the United States Small Business Administration, small
businesses make up 97.1% of all employers in Arizona and employ over two-fifths
of this state's private workforce; and
Whereas, according to
a 2014 study conducted by American Express OPEN, the number of women-owned
firms grew at a rate one and one-half times the national average; and
Whereas, the American
Express OPEN study estimated that, as of 2014, there were nearly 9.1 million
women-owned enterprises nationally, employing nearly 7.9 million workers and
generating over $1.4 trillion in revenues; and
Whereas, the
percentage of women-owned small business employers in this state is steadily
increasing; and
Whereas, Arizona ranks
as one of the top states for women-owned firms in terms of growth in number and
economic clout; and
Whereas, Latina
business owners are a growing force behind this trend; and
Whereas, the American
Express OPEN study estimated that Latinas owned more than one million firms
nationally in 2014 and generated an estimated $71.1 billion in revenue; and
Whereas, over the past
17 years, the number of Latina-owned firms has more than tripled, increasing by
206% nationally; and
Whereas, a 2012
Kauffman Firm Survey found that Latina-owned businesses represent the fastest
growing segment of the women-owned business market; and
Whereas, Latina
business owners help retain local jobs and empower their respective
communities, and their achievements and talents as entrepreneurs must be
acknowledged; and
Whereas, the Arizona
Hispanic Chamber of Commerce offers a Latina Business Enterprises program that
provides ongoing training and capacitybuilding initiatives to Latina
business owners; and
Whereas, organizations
such as Local First Arizona and Fuerza Local have started an Accelerator
Program that is designed to teach Spanishspeaking business owners
important basic skills that are necessary for owning and operating a business;
and
Whereas, it is
important to recognize the efforts of these organizations that provide support
to Latina-owned businesses, which greatly benefit Arizona's economy and
contribute to the fabric of its communities; and
Whereas, these
organizations provide increased appreciation, support and devotion of resources
such as technical assistance and programs to Latina business owners, which
serves to strengthen Arizona's overall economic activity and growth.
Therefore
Be it resolved by the House of Representatives of the State of
Arizona, the Senate concurring:
That the Members of
the Legislature support the continued development and success of Arizona's
Latina business leaders and the organizations that support them.
