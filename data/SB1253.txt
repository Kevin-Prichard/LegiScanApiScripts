START_STATUTE38-891.01.Retired member; return to work; employer contributions
A.An employer shall pay contributions at an
alternate contribution rate on behalf of a retired member who returns to work
in any capacity in a position ordinarily filled by an employee of the employer
in a designated position. This section applies to a retired member who has
been retired for more than twelve consecutive months.
B.The alternate contribution rate shall be equal to
that portion of the total required contribution that is applied to the
amortization of the unfunded actuarial accrued liability for the fiscal year
beginning July 1, based on the fund's actuary's calculation of the total
required contribution for the preceding fiscal year ended on June 30. The
alternate contribution rate shall be applied to the compensation, gross salary
or contract fee of a retired member who meets the requirements of this section.
C.The alternate contribution rate shall not be less
than six per cent percent in any fiscal year. 
D.All contributions made by the employer and
allocated to the fund established by section 38882 are irrevocable and
shall be used as benefits under this article or to pay the expenses of the
plan. Payments made pursuant to this section by employers become delinquent
after the due date prescribed in section 38891, subsection C, and
thereafter shall be increased by interest from and after that date until
payment is received by the plan.
E.An employer of a retired member shall submit any
reports, data, paperwork or materials that are requested by the board and that
are necessary to determine the compensation, gross salary or contract fee
associated with a retired member who returns to work or to determine the
function, use, efficacy or operation of the return to work program. END_STATUTE
