(TEXT OF BILL BEGINS ON NEXT PAGE)





To the Congress of the United States of America:
Your memorialist respectfully
represents:
Whereas, the United States and
Mexico are important trading partners, and commerce between the two countries
is a critical source of jobs, income and exchange; and
Whereas, according to the United
States Department of Commerce, more than $500 billion in bilateral trade and
over $100 billion occurs in crossborder investment annually; and
Whereas, in Arizona, $28 billion in
two-way trade is processed annually through Arizona's ports of entry; and
Whereas, according to the United
States Census Bureau, Arizona exports to Mexico totaled $7.1 billion in 2013;
and
Whereas, the prime conduits for
cross-border trade are through the ports of entry in Nogales, Douglas and San
Luis, Arizona; and
Whereas, the Customs Field Office
personnel within the United States Custom and Border Protection service of the
United States Department of Homeland Security serve a vital function in
promoting security and economic stability; and
Whereas, the lack of capacity and
staffing for customs inspections at these primary entry points create
congestion for incoming and outgoing goods, hampers commercial activity and
potentially compromises border security; and
Whereas, these impediments
ultimately translate into perished agricultural produce and lost business
opportunities and income; and
Whereas, the rapid delivery of
goods and commerce enhances business activity and strengthens economic
integration; and
Whereas, greater inspection
capacity at the United States border at the ports of entry in Nogales, Douglas
and San Luis, Arizona will enhance the safety and swiftness of goods moving
across the border, benefiting the economies of both nations; and
Whereas, increasing the number of
Customs Field Office personnel at these ports will facilitate commercial
traffic and will result in increased economic growth and stability for Arizona;
and
Whereas, the letter dated October
14, 2014, signed by every member of the Arizona Congressional delegation and
sent to the United States Department of Homeland Security expressed the need
for greater staffing and allocation of personnel to Arizona's ports of entry.
Wherefore your
memorialist, the Senate of the State of Arizona, the House of Representatives
concurring, prays:
1.That the United
States Congress act expediently to increase and maintain staffing for qualified
and properly vetted Customs Field Office personnel at the ports of entry in
Nogales, Douglas and San Luis, Arizona in order to prudently speed the flow of
goods and commerce.
2.That the Secretary of
State of the State of Arizona transmit copies of this Memorial to the President
of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of
Representatives and each Member of Congress from the State of Arizona.
