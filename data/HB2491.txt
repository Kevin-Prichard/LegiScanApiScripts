(TEXT OF BILL BEGINS ON NEXT PAGE)





Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Arizona:
Section1.Section 3-3433, Arizona Revised
Statutes, is amended to read:
START_STATUTE3-3433.Standards for motor fuel; exceptions
A.Except as provided in section 33434 and
subsections C, D, E, F, G, K and L of this section, a retail seller or fleet
owner shall not store, sell or expose or offer for sale any motor fuel,
kerosene, oil or other liquid or gaseous fuel or lubricating oil, lubricant,
mixtures of lubricants or other similar products if the product fails to meet
the standards specified in this section and in the rules adopted by the
associate director.
B.A person shall not misrepresent the nature,
origination, quality, grade or identity of any product specified in subsection
A of this section or represent the nature, origination, quality, grade or
identity of such product in any manner calculated or tending to mislead or in
any way deceive. This subsection does not prohibit product origination
disclaimer labeling on the retail dispenser.
C.After consultation with the director of the department
of environmental quality, the standards and test methods for motor fuels shall
be established by the associate director of the division by rule.
D.Maximum vapor pressure for gasoline that is
supplied or sold by any person and that is intended as a final product for the
fueling of motor vehicles in a county with a population of one million two
hundred thousand or more persons and any portion of a county contained in area
A as defined in section 49541 shall be 9.0 pounds per square inch from
and after September 30 through March 31 of each year, except that for the transition month of October, vapor
pressure may vary between 7.0 and 9.0 pounds per square inch.Fuel
used in motor vehicles at a manufacturer's proving ground or a motor vehicle
racing event as defined by section 33491 is exempt from this subsection.
E.From and after September 30 through March 31 of
each year, a person shall not supply or sell gasoline that exceeds the ASTM
D4814 class A vapor pressure/distillation class ten volume percent evaporated
distillation temperature.
F.Maximum vapor pressure for gasoline that is
supplied or sold by any person and that is intended as a final product for the
fueling of motor vehicles in a county with a population of one million two
hundred thousand persons or more and any portion of a county contained in area
A as defined in section 49541 shall be 7.0 pounds per square inch from
and after May 31 through September 30 of each year, except that for the transition month of June, vapor
pressure may vary between 7.0 and 9.0 pounds per square inch.Fuel
used in motor vehicles at a manufacturer's proving ground or a motor vehicle
racing event as defined by section 33491 is exempt from this subsection.
G.Exclusively for
the purposes of transportation conformity and only if the administrator of the
United States environmental protection agency fails to approve the applicable
plan required pursuant to section 49406, maximum vapor pressure for
gasoline that is supplied or sold by any person and that is intended as a final
product for the fueling of motor vehicles in area B as defined in section 49541
shall be ten pounds per square inch from and after September 30 through March
31 of each year.Fuel used in motor vehicles at a manufacturer's
proving ground or a motor vehicle racing event as defined by section 33491
is exempt from this subsection.
H.Notwithstanding subsections D, F and G of this
section, the associate director of the division in consultation with the
director of the department of environmental quality shall approve alternate
fuel control measures that are submitted by manufacturers or suppliers of
gasoline and that the director and the associate director determine will result
in either of the following:
1.Motor vehicle carbon monoxide emissions that are
equal to or less than emissions that result under compliance with subsection D
of this section and section 33493.In making this
determination, the associate director of the division and the director of the
department of environmental quality shall compare the emissions of the
alternate fuel control measure with the emissions of a fuel with a maximum
vapor pressure standard as prescribed by this section and with the minimum
oxygen content or percentage by volume of ethanol as prescribed by section 33493.
2.Motor vehicle nonmethane hydrocarbon
emissions that are equal to or less than the emissions that result under
compliance with subsection F of this section.In making this
determination, the associate director of the division and the director of the
department of environmental quality shall compare the motor vehicle nonmethane
hydrocarbon emissions of the alternate fuel control measure with the motor
vehicle nonmethane hydrocarbon emissions of a fuel that complies with
the maximum vapor pressure standard as prescribed by subsection F of this
section.
I.Any alternate fuel control measures that are
approved shall not increase emissions of nonmethane hydrocarbons,
particulates, carbon monoxide or oxides of nitrogen.Alternate fuel
control measures approved pursuant to subsection H of this section and this
subsection may be used by any manufacturer or supplier of gasoline unless the
approval is rescinded more than one hundred eighty days before the first day of
a gasoline control period.Manufacturers and suppliers who use an
approved alternate fuel control measure shall annually submit a compliance plan
to the associate director no later than sixty days before the first day of a
gasoline control period.
J.A person shall not sell or offer or expose for
sale diesel fuel grade 1, 2 or 4 as defined in ASTM D975 that contains sulfur
in excess of:
1.For low sulfur diesel fuel, five hundred parts
per million by weight for use in area A as defined in section 49541.
2.For ultra low sulfur diesel fuel, the amount that
conforms with 40 Code of Federal Regulations section 80.520(a)(1).
K.A person shall not sell or offer or expose for
sale diesel fuel, biodiesel or biodiesel blends that contain sulfur in excess
of five hundred parts per million for use in area A as defined in section 49541.
L.A person shall label dispensers at which
biodiesel or biodiesel blends are dispensed in conformance with 16 Code of
Federal Regulations part 306 and 40 Code of Federal Regulations sections 80.570,
80.571, 80.572, 80.573 and 80.574. This section does not preclude a person
from labeling a dispenser that dispenses diesel fuel that contains up to five
percent biodiesel with a label that states "may contain up to five percent
biodiesel".
M.For biodiesel blends that contain more than five
percent by volume of biodiesel, a person shall prepare product transfer
documents in a manner that notifies the transferee of the percent by volume of
biodiesel in the product.For diesel fuel that contains five percent
or less by volume of biodiesel, a person shall prepare product transfer
documents in a manner that notifies that transferee of any volume percent of
biodiesel intentionally added to or known by the transferor to be in the
product.
N.The associate director shall adopt rules
regarding the establishment and enforcement of all of the following:
1.National or federal standards for individual
biofuels and biofuel blends.
2.United States environmental protection agency and
ASTM test methods for individual biofuels and biofuel blends.
3.Registration and reporting requirements for
producers, blenders and suppliers of biofuels and biofuel blends.
4.Labeling requirements for biofuels and biofuel
blends other than biodiesel or biodiesel blends.
5.Quality assurance and quality control programs

Code of Federal Regulations sections 80.570, 80.571, 80.572, 80.573 and 80.574
to inform the customer of the sulfur content of the diesel fuel being
dispensed.
Q.A person shall label each dispenser at which low
sulfur diesel fuel is dispensed in a manner that conforms with 40 Code of

diesel fuel or distillate, except if the diesel fuel is dispensed into a motor
vehicle or nonroad, locomotive or marine equipment, the transferor shall
provide to the transferee product transfer documents that conform with 40 Code
of Federal Regulations section 80.590.
S.If the transfer of a motor fuel is from a
