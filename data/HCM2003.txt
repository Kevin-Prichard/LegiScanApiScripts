to the expenditure of State Bar of Arizona member dues.

(TEXT OF BILL BEGINS ON NEXT PAGE)





To the Arizona Supreme Court:
Your memorialist respectfully represents:
Whereas, integrated bar
associations "implicate the First Amendment freedom of association, which
includes the freedom to choose not to associate, and the First Amendment
freedom of speech, which also includes the freedom to remain silent or to avoid
subsidizing group speech with which a person disagrees," Kingstad v.
State Bar of Wis., 622 F.3d 708, 712-13 (7th Cir. 2010); and
Whereas, in Keller v. State Bar
of California, 496 U.S. 1 (1990), the United States Supreme court held that
California's integrated bar interfered with the First Amendment freedoms of its
members by using their dues for political and ideological activities and that
members' dues may be used only for activities such as the regulation of the
legal profession or the improvement of legal services; and
Whereas, the State Bar of Arizona
admittedly spends its members' dues on political speech, including lobbying and
electioneering; and
Whereas, the State Bar of Arizona
undoubtedly takes political positions with which some of its members disagree
and uses the mandatory fees of those members to do so; and
Whereas, the process to determine
how the State Bar of Arizona spends member dues in reference to political
activity lacks transparency; and
Whereas, the Arizona Supreme Court
has asserted a claim to exclusive authority over the regulation of attorneys
and the governance of the State Bar of Arizona.
Wherefore your memorialist, the House of Representatives of
the State of  Arizona, the Senate concurring, prays:
1.That the Arizona Supreme Court establish
improved transparency measures with respect to the practices and policies of
the State Bar of Arizona in spending member dues.
2.That the Secretary of State transmit
copies of this Memorial to each justice of the Arizona Supreme Court.
