EFFORTS.

(TEXT OF BILL BEGINS ON NEXT PAGE)





Whereas, the United
States Coast Guard Auxiliary is the community volunteer lifesaving arm of the
United States Coast Guard; and
Whereas, Lake Powell
alone has more miles of coastline than does the entire west coast of the United
States; and
Whereas, the United
States Coast Guard Auxiliary in Arizona has more than 200 members that together
volunteered over 50,000 hours of their personal time during 2015; and
Whereas, United States
Coast Guard Auxiliary members conducted over 600 vessel safety checks of
Arizona boaters to ensure that the watercraft met the minimum federal and
Arizona safety requirements; and
Whereas, United States
Coast Guard Auxiliary members conducted over 540 visits to Arizona marine
dealers in 2015, helping maritime dealers and their customers increase their
knowledge of boating safety; and
Whereas, United States
Coast Guard Auxiliary members provided 13 boating safety classes, which
directly impact the safety of hundreds of Arizona boaters; and
Whereas, United States
Coast Guard Auxiliary members offered their personal watercraft to patrol
Arizona waterways more than 500 times during 2015; and
Whereas, United States
Coast Guard Auxiliary members contacted over 6,000 boats and over 20,000
boaters in 2015, assisting 217 boats and 676 boaters in distress and saving 76
lives; and
Whereas, the efforts
of the United States Coast Guard Auxiliary resulted in a significant downturn
in the number of boating injuries and fatalities in Arizona during 2015; and
Whereas, the work of
the United States Coast Guard Auxiliary provides a valuable service to the
United States Coast Guard, enabling them to focus greater resources on
safeguarding this nation's maritime interests, protecting the maritime economy
and environment, defending our maritime borders and saving those in peril.
Therefore
Be it resolved by the Senate of the State of Arizona, the House
of Representatives concurring:
That the Members of
the Legislature recognize and honor the lifesaving work of the Arizona members
of the United States Coast Guard Auxiliary and commend these volunteers for the
vital support role they play in the mission of the United States Coast Guard.
