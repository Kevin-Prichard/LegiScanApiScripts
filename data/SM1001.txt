(TEXT OF BILL BEGINS ON NEXT PAGE)





To the Members of
the United States Congress from the State of Arizona:
Your memorialist respectfully represents:
Whereas, Christians, Yazidis and other religious minorities in
the Middle East are being subjected to systematic and violent persecution at
the hands of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and other terrorist groups;
and
Whereas, these people are being murdered, kidnapped, sexually
abused, tortured and victimized in other ways that violate the laws of their
own nations, the international community and the United Nations Convention on
the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Convention); and
Whereas, the victims of this brutal persecution are being
specifically targeted based on their religious or ethnic affiliation with the
intent to facilitate the annihilation or forced migration of communities with
longstanding ties to their region; and
Whereas, the Convention defines "genocide" as killing
members of a national, ethnic, racial or religious group, causing them serious
bodily or mental harm, intentionally enforcing living conditions designed to cause
the partial or total physical destruction of the group, preventing births
within the group or transferring the children of the group to another group
with the intent to destroy the group in total or in part; and
Whereas, the Convention holds that genocide is a crime that
governments are obligated to prevent and for which perpetrators are to be held
responsible; and
Whereas, the United States Commission on Religious Freedom, the
Hudson Institute for Religious Freedom, the International Association of Genocide
Scholars, Pope Francis, Hillary Clinton and many other organizations and
religious and political leaders have called on the United States to recognize
the persecution of Christians and other religious minorities in the Middle East
as genocide; and
Whereas, the United States Congress has introduced House
Concurrent Resolution 75, Senate Resolution 340 and at least five other bills
designed to recognize the genocide and facilitate expedited support and aid for
Christians and other religious minorities in the Middle East; and
Whereas, the designation of the persecution of Christians and
other religious minorities in the Middle East as genocide has real, practical
policy implications and can help expedite various solutions to the crisis; and
Whereas, the Members of the Senate of the State of Arizona
officially recognize the persecution of Christians and other religious
minorities in the Middle East as genocide.
Wherefore your memorialist, the Senate
of the State of Arizona, prays:
1.That each Member of Congress from the State of
Arizona cosponsor legislation similar to House Concurrent Resolution 75,
support other congressional efforts to aid victims of the persecution of
Christians and other religious minorities in the Middle East and encourage the
United States government to take greater concrete action to end the genocide.
2.That the Secretary of State of the State of
Arizona transmit copies of this Memorial to the President of the United States,
the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, the Majority Leader
of the United States Senate and each Member of Congress from the State of
Arizona.
