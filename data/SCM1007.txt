A CONCURRENT MEMORIAL

urging the United
States Environmental Protection Agency to reinstate the previous ozone
concentration standard of 75 parts per billion.


(TEXT OF BILL BEGINS ON NEXT PAGE)





To the Administrator of the United States Environmental
Protection Agency:
Your memorialist respectfully represents:
Whereas, on October 1, 2015, the United States Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) reduced the national ambient air quality standards for
groundlevel ozone from 75 parts per billion (ppb) to 70 ppb; and
Whereas, the State of Arizona will have great difficulty in
implementing this new ozone concentration standard due to factors that are
outside of this state's control, including its proximity to California, extreme
heat and intense summer sunshine; and
Whereas, before the implementation of the new ozone concentration
standard, the EPA reported that 358 counties in the nation would violate a
standard of 70 ppb based on monitoring data from 2011 through 2013; and
Whereas, nonattainment area designations will limit economic
and job growth by restricting new and expanded industrial and manufacturing
facilities, imposing emission "offset" requirements on new and
modified major sources of nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds
emissions, constraining oil and gas extraction and raising electricity prices
for industries and consumers; and
Whereas, low-income and fixed-income citizens will bear the
brunt of higher energy costs and utility bills; and
Whereas, air quality continues to improve, and nitrogen oxide
emissions are already down to 60% nationwide since 1980, which, after adjusting
for economic growth, implies a 90% reduction in emission rates from the
relatively uncontrolled 1990 rates for nitrogen oxide-emitting sources; and
Whereas, average ozone concentrations have decreased
significantly in both urban and rural areas over the past two decades in
response to state and federal emission control programs; and
Whereas, instead of giving states enough time to meet the
previous ozone concentration standard of 75 ppb through ongoing emission
reduction programs, the EPA moved the goalpost by imposing a lower standard;
and
Whereas, reinstating the previous
ozone concentration standard of 75 ppb would provide for continued air quality
improvement throughout the nation as emission reduction programs under EPA
regulations are implemented.
Wherefore your
memorialist, the Senate of the State of Arizona, the House of Representatives
concurring, prays:
1.That the United States Environmental Protection
Agency reinstate the previous ozone concentration standard of 75 ppb.
2.That the Secretary of State of the State of
Arizona transmit copies of this Memorial to the Administrator of the United
States Environmental Protection Agency, the President of the United States, the
President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House
of Representatives and each Member of Congress from the State of Arizona.
