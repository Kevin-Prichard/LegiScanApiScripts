fee; expiration
A.Except as provided in section 324301, each
holder of a regular license shall renew the license every other year on or
before the licensee's birthday by paying the prescribed renewal fee and
supplying the board with information it deems necessary, including proof of
having completed, before the renewal date, forty hours of category I continuing
medical education approved by the American academy of physician assistants, the
American medical association, the American osteopathic association or any other
accrediting organization acceptable to the board. The board shall verify
continuing medical education compliance and shall randomly audit at least ten
percent of physician assistants who are renewing their license within the
calendar year and who do not hold a current national certification from a
national certification organization for physician assistants that is approved
by the board.
B.Except as provided in section 324301, a
holder of a regular license who fails to renew the license within thirty days
after the licensee's birthday shall pay a penalty fee as set forth in rule for
late renewal.
C.Except as provided in section 324301, if a
holder of a regular license fails to renew the license within ninety days after
the licensee's birthday, the license automatically expires. It is unlawful for
a person to perform health care tasks of a physician assistant after the
license expires.
D.A person whose license expires may reapply for
licensure pursuant to this chapter.
E.If a licensee does not meet the requirements of
subsection A of this section because of that person's illness, religious
missionary activity or residence in a foreign country or any other extenuating
circumstance, the board may grant an extension of the deadline if it receives a
written request to do so from the licensee that details the reasons for this
request.
F.A
licensee who holds a certification from a certifying body approved by the board
may use the continuing medical education credits obtained for certification to
satisfy the requirements for continuing medical education required in
subsection A of this section. END_STATUTE
