national origin or on the basis of disability or veteran status.
B.It is an unlawful employment practice for an
employer:
1.To fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any

because of the individual's race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, age or
national origin or on the basis of disability or veteran status.
2.To limit, segregate or classify employees or
applicants for employment in any way which
that would deprive or
tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise

or on the basis of disability or
veteran status.

otherwise discriminate against any individual based on the results of a genetic

this section.

employment agency to fail or refuse to refer for employment or otherwise to
discriminate against any individual because of the individual's race, color,
religion, sex, sexual orientation,
gender identity, age or national origin or on the basis of
disability or veteran status or

or veteran status.

orientation, gender identity, age or national origin or on the
basis of disability or veteran status.

applicants for membership or to classify or fail or refuse to refer for

race, color, religion, sex, sexual
orientation, gender identity, age or national origin or on the
basis of disability or veteran status.

employment in any program established to provide apprenticeship or other
training and, if the individual is an otherwise qualified individual, to fail
or refuse to reasonably accommodate the individual's disability.
F.With respect to a qualified individual, it is an
unlawful employment practice for a covered entity to:

arrangement or relationship that has the effect of subjecting a qualified
individual who applies with or who is employed by the covered entity to

administration that have the effect of discriminating on the basis of
disability or that perpetuate the discrimination of others who are subject to

to an individual qualified for the job or benefits because of the known
disability of an individual with whom the individual qualified for the job or
benefits is known to have a relationship or association.
4.Not make reasonable accommodations to the known
physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual who is an
applicant or employee unless the covered entity can demonstrate that the

of the covered entity or the individual only meets the definition of disability
as prescribed in section 411461, paragraph 4, subdivision (c).
5.Deny employment opportunities to a job applicant
or employee who is an otherwise qualified individual if the denial is based on
the need of the covered entity to make reasonable accommodation to the physical
or mental impairment of the applicant or employee.

other selection criteria, including those based on an individual's uncorrected
vision, that screen out or tend to screen out an individual with a disability

selection criteria, as used by the covered entity, is shown to be job related
for the position in question and is consistent with business necessity.
7.Fail to select and administer tests relating to
employment in the most effective manner to ensure that, when the test is
administered to a job applicant or employee who has a disability that impairs
sensory, manual or speaking skills, the test results accurately reflect the
skills or aptitude or whatever other factor of the applicant or employee that
the test purports to measure, rather than reflecting the impaired sensory,
manual or speaking skills of the applicant or employee, except if the skills
are the factors that the test purports to measure.
G.Notwithstanding any other provision of this
article, it is not an unlawful employment practice:
1.For an employer to hire and employ employees, for
an employment agency to classify or refer for employment any individual, for a
labor organization to classify its membership or classify or refer for
employment any individual,
or for an employer, labor organization or joint labormanagement
committee controlling apprenticeship or other training or retraining programs
to admit or employ any individual in any such program, on the basis of the
individual's religion, sex or national origin in those certain instances when
religion, sex or national origin is a bona fide occupational qualification
reasonably necessary to the normal operation of that particular business or
enterprise, provided that if sex is a
bona fide occupational qualification individuals are recognized as qualified
based on their gender identity.
2.For any school, college, university or other
educational institution or institution of learning to hire and employ employees
of a particular religion if the school, college, university or other
educational institution or institution of learning is in whole or in

institution of learning is directed toward the propagation of a particular
religion.

employ any individual for any position, for an employment agency to fail or
refuse to refer any individual for employment in any position or for a labor

(a)The occupancy of the position or access to the
premises in or upon which any part of the duties of the position are performed
or are to be performed is subject to any requirement imposed in the interest of
the national security of the United States under any security program in effect
pursuant to or administered under any statute of the United States or any
executive order of the president of the United States.
(b)The individual has not fulfilled or has ceased
to fulfill that requirement.
4.With respect to age, for an employer, employment
agency or labor organization:
(a)To take any action otherwise prohibited under
subsection B, C or D of this section if age is a bona fide occupational
qualification reasonably necessary to the normal operation of the particular
business or if the differentiation is based on reasonable factors other than
age.
(b)To observe the terms of a bona fide seniority
system or any bona fide employee benefit plan such as a retirement, pension,
deferred compensation or insurance plan, which is not a subterfuge to evade the
purposes of the age discrimination provisions of this article, except that no
employee benefit plan may excuse the failure to hire any individual and no
seniority system or employee benefit plan may require or permit the involuntary
retirement of any individual specified by section 411465 because of the
individual's age.
(c)To discharge or otherwise discipline an
individual for good cause.
H.As used in this article, unlawful employment
practice does not include any action or measure taken by an employer, labor

States or of any other organization required to register as a communistaction
or communistfront organization by final order of the subversive
activities control board pursuant to the subversive activities control act of
1950.
I.Notwithstanding any other provision of this
article, it is not an unlawful employment practice:
1.For an employer to apply different standards of
compensation or different terms, conditions or privileges of employment
pursuant to a bona fide seniority or merit system or a system which that
measures earnings by quantity or quality of production or to
employees who work in different locations, provided that these differences are
not the result of an intention to discriminate because of race, color,
religion, sex, sexual orientation,
gender identity, veteran status or national origin.
2.For an employer to give and act upon on
the results of any professionally developed ability test provided
that the test, its administration or action upon the results is not designed,
intended or used to discriminate because of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity,
veteran status or national origin.
3.For any employer to differentiate upon on
the basis of sex or disability in determining the amount of the
wages or compensation paid or to be paid to employees of the employer if the
differentiation is authorized by the provisions of section 6(d) or section 14
of the fair labor standards act of 1938, as amended (29 United States Code
section 206(d)).
J.Nothing contained in this chapter applies to any
business or enterprise on or near an Indian reservation with respect to any
publicly announced employment practice of the business or enterprise under
which a preferential treatment is given to any individual because the
individual is an Indian living on or near a reservation.
K.Nothing contained in this article or article 6 of
this chapter requires any employer, employment agency, labor organization or
joint labormanagement committee subject to this article to grant
preferential treatment to any individual or group because of the race, color,
religion, sex, sexual orientation,
gender identity, veteran status or national origin of the
individual or group on account of an imbalance which that
may exist with respect to the total number or percentage of
persons of any race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, veteran status or
national origin employed by any employer, referred or classified for employment
by any employment agency or labor organization, admitted to membership or
classified by any labor organization or admitted to or employed in any
apprenticeship or other training program, in comparison with the total number
or percentage of persons of that race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, veteran status
or national origin in any community, state, section or other area, or in the
available work force workforce in any community,
state, section or other area.
L.Nothing in the age discrimination prohibitions of
this article may be construed to prohibit compulsory retirement of any employee
who has attained sixtyfive years of age and who, for the two-year period
immediately before retirement, is employed in a bona fide executive or high
policymaking position, if the employee is entitled to an immediate
nonforfeitable annual retirement benefit from a pension, profit sharing,
savings or deferred compensation plan or any combination of plans of the
employer for the employee, which
that equals, in the
aggregate, at least fortyfour thousand dollars. In applying the
retirement benefit test of this subsection, if any retirement benefit is in a
form other than a straight life annuity, with no ancillary benefits, or if
employees contribute to the plan or make rollover contributions, the benefit
shall be adjusted in accordance with rules adopted by the division so the
benefit is the equivalent of a straight life annuity, with no ancillary
benefits, under a plan to which employees do not contribute and under which no
rollover contributions are made.
M.A covered entity may require that an individual
with a disability shall not pose a direct threat to the health or safety of
other individuals in the workplace. For the purposes of this subsection,
"direct threat" means a significant risk to the health or safety of
others that cannot be eliminated by reasonable accommodation.
N.This article does not alter the standards for
determining eligibility for benefits under this state's workers' compensation
laws or under state and federal disability benefit programs.
O.For the purposes of this section and section 411481,
with respect to employers or employment practices involving a disability,
"individual" means a qualified individual. END_STATUTE

occurred.A charge is deemed filed upon receipt by the division from
or on behalf of a person claiming to be aggrieved or, if filed by a member of
the division, when executed by such member upon oath or
affirmation.A charge is deemed filed by or on behalf of a person
claiming to be aggrieved if received from the United States equal employment
opportunity commission.A charge shall be in writing upon oath or
affirmation and shall contain such information, including the date, place and
circumstances of the alleged unlawful employment practice, and be in such form
as the division requires.Charges shall not be made public by the
division.
B.Whenever a charge is filed by or on behalf of a
person claiming to be aggrieved or by a member of the division, referred to as
the charging party, alleging that an employer, employment agency, labor
organization or joint labormanagement committee controlling apprenticeship
or other training or retraining programs, including onthejob
training programs, has engaged in an unlawful employment practice, the division
shall serve notice of and a copy of the charge on such employer, employment
agency, labor organization or joint labormanagement committee, referred
to as the respondent, within ten days and shall make an investigation of the
charge.If the division determines after such investigation that
there is not reasonable cause to believe that the charge is true, it shall
enter an order determining the same and dismissing the charge and shall notify
the charging party and the respondent of its action.If the division
determines after such investigation that there is reasonable cause to believe
that the charge is true, it shall enter an order containing its findings of
fact and shall endeavor to eliminate the alleged unlawful employment practice
by informal methods of conference, conciliation and persuasion.Any
party to such informal proceeding may be represented by counsel.Counsel
need not be a member of the state bar if he is licensed to practice law in any
other state or territory of the United States.Nothing said or done
during and as a part of such informal endeavors may be made public by the
division or its officers or employees or used as evidence in a subsequent
proceeding without the written consent of the persons concerned.If
a civil action resulting from a charge is commenced in any federal or state
court, evidence collected by or submitted to the division during the
investigation of the charge and the source of the evidence shall be subject to
discovery by the parties to the civil action.Any person who makes
public information in violation of this subsection is guilty of a class 1
misdemeanor.The division shall make its determination on reasonable
cause as promptly as possible and as far as practicable not later than sixty
days from the filing of the charge.If more than two years have
elapsed after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred, and if the
charging party has received a notice of right to sue, the division may cease
investigation of a charge without reaching a determination.
C.All conciliation agreements shall provide that
the charging party waives, releases and covenants not to sue the respondent or
claim against the respondent in any forum with respect to the matters which
were alleged as charges filed with the division, subject to performance by the
respondent of the promises and representations contained in the conciliation agreement.
The charging party or the respondent may prepare a conciliation agreement which
the division shall submit to the other party and which, if accepted by the
other party, shall be accepted by the division.
D.If within thirty days after the division has made
a determination that reasonable cause exists to believe that the charge is true
the division has not accepted a conciliation agreement to which the charging
party and the respondent are parties, the division may bring a civil action
against the respondent, other than the state, named in the
charge.The charging party shall have the right to intervene in a
civil action brought by the division.If a charge filed with the
division pursuant to subsection A of this section is dismissed by the division
