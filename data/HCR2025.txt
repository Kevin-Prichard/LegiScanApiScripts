A CONCURRENT RESOLUTION

Declaring Arizona
to be a purple heart state and proclaiming December 7, 2016 as Arizona Purple
Heart Day.


(TEXT OF BILL BEGINS ON NEXT PAGE)





Whereas, the Purple
Heart is the oldest military decoration in the United States in present use;
and
Whereas, General
George Washington established the Purple Heart during the Revolutionary War in
Newburgh, New York on August 7, 1782 as an incentive for members of the
Continental Army; and
Whereas, the Purple
Heart was the first award made available to the common soldier to recognize
outstanding valor or merit; and
Whereas, the Purple
Heart is a combat decoration that is awarded to living military members of the
United States armed forces who are wounded by an instrument of war in the hands
of the enemy or that is awarded posthumously to the next of kin in the name of
those who were killed in action or who died from wounds received in action; and
Whereas, recipients of
the Purple Heart know the meaning of sacrifice in the preservation of the
United States of America and national interests at home and abroad; and
Whereas, there are
approximately 1.7 million Purple Heart recipients in our nation's history, many
of whom are from the State of Arizona; and
Whereas, to perpetually
honor this state's Purple Heart recipients, it is fitting to declare Arizona to
be a Purple Heart State.
Therefore
Be it resolved by the House of Representatives of the State of
Arizona, the Senate concurring:
1.That the
Members of the Legislature declare the State of Arizona to be a Purple Heart
State and proclaim December 7, 2016 as Arizona Purple Heart Day.
2.That the
Members of the Legislature support efforts by the people of Arizona to pay
special tribute to current and former members of the United States armed forces
who have received the Purple Heart and to honor the families of fallen Purple
Heart recipients.
