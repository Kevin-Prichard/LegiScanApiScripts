A MEMORIAL

urging the United
States Congress to oppose certain trade deals.

(TEXT OF BILL BEGINS ON NEXT PAGE)





To the Congress of the United States of America:
Your memorialist respectfully represents:
Whereas, United States trade deals for the past 25 years have
been corporate-driven, incorporating rules that skew benefits to economic
elites while requiring working families to bear the brunt of such policies; and
Whereas, the growing trade deficits, driven by the North
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), China's accession to the World Trade
Organization and the United States-Korea Free Trade Agreement, have displaced
700,000 American jobs, 3.2 million American jobs and 75,000 American jobs,
respectively; and
Whereas, United States employment in manufacturing dropped by 5
million workers from 2000 to 2015; and
Whereas, jobs lost due to trade policies devastate families and
entire communities and can permanently reduce lifetime earnings for hundreds of
thousands of workers; and
Whereas, the offshoring of manufacturing and service jobs
deprives local and state governments of sorely needed revenues, jeopardizing
the livelihoods of millions of public servants as well as construction workers
whose jobs depend on infrastructure building, repair and maintenance; and
Whereas, NAFTA and all but two of the United States trade deals
that followed include special legal rights for foreign investors that allow
foreign firms to bypass state and federal courts to challenge state and local
laws, regulations and administrative and judicial decisions in international
courts in a process known as investor-to-state dispute settlement (ISDS); and
Whereas, foreign investors already have used NAFTA's ISDS
provisions to challenge decisions regarding local building permits,
environmental regulations, state bans on toxic chemicals and decisions of state
courts; and
Whereas, promoting economic growth with equity in Arizona
requires an approach that reforms the entire trade negotiation process to
ensure that the voices of workers, farmers, small businesses, families and
communities are heard and their interests are addressed; and
Whereas, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) has been
negotiated in secret, effectively shutting state and local governments out of
the process and limiting the ability of the State of Arizona to influence the
agreement's rules to ensure that the people of Arizona can participate in the
benefits of trade; and
Whereas, repeating old mistakes in negotiating new trade
agreements such as the TPP will result in missed opportunities to strengthen
the economy of the United States, reduce income inequality and provide
sustainable growth.
Wherefore your
memorialist, the House of Representatives of the State of Arizona, prays:
1.That the Members of the United States Congress
oppose the TPP and any other similar trade deal that fails to restructure the
misguided and failed policies of the past.
2.That the Members of the United States Congress
support a new trade deal such as the TPP only if the trade deal will accomplish
the following:
(a)Protect and promote
traditional state and local prerogatives and authority under the federal system
by ensuring that states and localities will not be required to comply with
certain commitments, including any restrictions on preferences for local, state
or United States goods or services, without prior informed consent of the
legislature or local lawmaking body.
(b)Ensure balanced trade
and address the excessive, job-killing United States trade deficit.
(c)Exclude ISDS and other
provisions that favor foreign companies over domestic ones and undermine public
choices.
(d)Ensure that countries
cannot undercut United States-based producers with weaker labor and
environmental laws and enforcement.
(e)Ensure that the United
States will engage in robust enforcement of trade rules, including labor and
environmental rules.
(f)Include strong rule of
origin to promote economic growth and job creation in the United States.
(g)Promote high standards
of protection for workplaces, products and natural resources.
3.That the Secretary of
State of the State of Arizona transmit copies of this Memorial to the President
of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of
Representatives and each Member of Congress from the State of Arizona.
