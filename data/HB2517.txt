Sec.4.Legislative findings; intent 
A.The legislature finds and declares that:
1.The right of individuals to pursue a chosen
business or profession, free from arbitrary or excessive government
interference, is a fundamental civil right.
2.The freedom to earn an honest living
traditionally has provided the surest means for economic mobility.
3.In recent years, many regulations of entry into
businesses and professions have exceeded legitimate public purposes and have
had the effect of arbitrarily limiting entry and reducing competition.
4.The burden of excessive regulation is borne most
heavily by individuals outside the economic mainstream, for whom opportunities
for economic advancement are curtailed.
B.Because it is in the public interest, by this act
the legislature intends to:
1.Ensure the right of all individuals to pursue
legitimate entrepreneurial and professional opportunities to the limits of
their talent and ambition.
2.Provide the means for the vindication of this
right.
3.Ensure that regulations of entry into businesses
and professions are demonstrably necessary and carefully tailored to fulfill
legitimate health, safety and welfare objectives.
Sec.5.Short title 
This act may be cited as the "Right to Earn a Living
Act".
