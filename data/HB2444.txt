dealers as prescribed by title 44, chapter 11, article 3.1, including the
authority of a city or town to license scrap metal dealers and enforce laws
relating to business licensing pursuant to section 441648. 
B.The regulation of an owner, operator or tenant of
a business, commercial building or multifamily housing property relating to
measuring and reporting energy use and consumption and the sale, use and

concern.The regulation of measuring and reporting energy use and
consumption by an owner, operator or tenant of a business, commercial building

containers by an owner, operator or tenant of a business, commercial building
or multifamily housing property pursuant to this section are not subject to
further regulation by a city or town.

particularly sensitive to costs and expenses incurred in complying with

benefiting from free and open competition.
D.This section does not prevent a city or town from
continuing a voluntary recycling and waste reduction program as authorized by
section 9500.07 or ensuring that discarded auxiliary containers defined
as solid waste pursuant to section 49701.01 are disposed of properly.

housing property.Auxiliary container does not include a stationary
receptacle intended solely for use by the public for voluntary donation of
