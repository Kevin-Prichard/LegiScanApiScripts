(TEXT OF BILL BEGINS ON NEXT PAGE)





Whereas, Arizonans can
prevent adverse childhood experiences by making it a goal to lead the nation in
the health and well-being of children; and
Whereas, adverse
childhood experiences are traumatic experiences that occur during childhood,
including physical, emotional or sexual abuse, neglect, substance abuse, untreated
mental illness, incarceration of a family member, domestic violence and
separation or divorce in the household; and
Whereas, children who
experience adverse childhood experiences are two and one-half times more likely
to fail a grade in school, score lower on standardized tests, be suspended or
expelled from school, be designated to special education and have poor health;
and
Whereas, nationally,
80% of suicide attempts by youth can be attributed to adverse childhood
experiences; and
Whereas, trauma in
childhood contributes to a lifetime of harms, including unhealthy behaviors,
disease, mental illness and early death; and
Whereas, 44.4% of
children in Arizona have experienced two or more adverse childhood experiences,
as compared to 30.5% of children nationally; and
Whereas, for the past
four years, Arizona has ranked in the bottom five states for the overall
well-being of children; and
Whereas, for the past
four years, Arizona has had the highest rate in the nation of students in
grades nine through twelve who think about and plan suicide; and
Whereas, in 2014, 40%
of eighth graders in Arizona and 29% of ninth through twelfth graders in
Arizona reported being bullied on school property, as compared to 19.6% of
ninth through twelfth graders nationally; and
Whereas, it has been
proven that preventive strategies are the most effective methods to treat, halt
and reverse the costly normalization of harm to children; and
Whereas, "The
Guts to Be Good" is a primary prevention initiative created by Arizona nonprofit
Peer Solutions to prevent the root causes of adverse childhood experiences
through the adoption of the following youthled, community-driven
solutions:
1.The
guts to speak up by advocating for the health and well-being of children
and giving them the skills to speak up, when they perceive it to be safe, if
they see or hear something that is harmful.
2.The
guts to be respectful by demonstrating and promoting empathy, compassion
and identity respect for others and self.
3.The
guts to be courteous by saying please and thank you, agreeing to disagree
and practicing kindness and gratitude.
4.The
guts to be honest by modeling and encouraging honesty, trust and healthy
relationships.
5.The
guts to lend a hand by volunteering, helping those in need and seeking
immediate assistance, when safe, if someone is being harmed, harming others or
harming themselves.
Therefore
Be it resolved by the Senate of the State of Arizona, the House
of Representatives concurring:
1.That the
Members of the Legislature declare that children of all political, religious
and other identities deserve to be safe and treated equally with respect.
2.That the
Members of the Legislature embrace the effectiveness of primary prevention
strategies to prevent adverse childhood experiences in Arizona.
3.That the
Members of the Legislature support youth-led efforts to prevent adverse
childhood experiences by using positive solutions such as "The Guts to Be
Good" initiative.
4.That the
Members of the Legislature are committed to investing in youth by creating and
supporting legislation with the input and support of families, schools,
businesses and community organizations to develop, implement, evaluate, sustain
and grow strategies to prevent adverse childhood experiences.
5.That the
Members of the Legislature understand that Arizona's children are tomorrow's
teachers, parents, policy makers and leaders and, therefore, the permanent
solution to building a better Arizona.
