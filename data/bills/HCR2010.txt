A CONCURRENT RESOLUTION

applying to the
congress of the united states to call a convention for proposing amendments to
the constitution of the united states.


(TEXT OF BILL BEGINS ON NEXT PAGE)





Whereas, the founders of the Constitution of the United States
empowered state legislators to be guardians of liberty against future abuses of
power by the federal government; and
Whereas, the federal government has created a crushing national
debt through improper and imprudent spending; and
Whereas, the federal government has invaded the legitimate role
of the states through the manipulative process of federal mandates, most of
which are unfunded to a great extent; and
Whereas, the federal government has ceased to live under a
proper interpretation of the Constitution of the United States; and
Whereas, it is the solemn duty of the states to protect the
liberty of our people, particularly for the generations to come, and to propose
amendments to the Constitution of the United States through a convention of the
states under Article V to place clear restraints on these and related abuses of
power.
Therefore
Be it resolved by the House of Representatives of the State of
Arizona, the Senate concurring:
1.That, pursuant to Article V of the Constitution
of the United States, the Legislature of the State of Arizona formally applies
to the Congress of the United States to call a convention of the states limited
to proposing amendments to the Constitution of the United States that impose
fiscal restraints on the federal government, limit the power and jurisdiction
of the federal government and limit the terms of office for its officials and
for members of Congress.
2.That this application constitutes a continuing
application in accordance with Article V of the Constitution of the United
States until at least two-thirds of the legislatures of the several states have
made application on the same subjects.
3.That this application is revoked, withdrawn,
nullified and superseded, retroactive to the date of enactment, if the
application is used for the purpose of calling a convention or is used in
support of conducting a convention to amend the Constitution of the United
States for any purpose other than to impose fiscal restraints on the federal
government, limit the power and jurisdiction of the federal government or limit
the terms of office for federal officials and members of Congress.
4.That the Secretary of State of the State of
Arizona transmit a copy of this Resolution to the President and Secretary of
the United States Senate, the Speaker and Clerk of the United States House of
Representatives, each Member of Congress from the State of Arizona and the
presiding officers of each house of the several state legislatures, requesting
their cooperation.
