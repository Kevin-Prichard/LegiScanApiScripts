or deal in spirituous liquors shall make application to the director on a form
prescribed and furnished by the director.
B.A person desiring a license within an
incorporated city or town shall make the application in triplicate and shall file
the copies with the director.The director shall remit two copies to
the city or town clerk. The city or town clerk shall immediately file one copy
in the clerk's office and post the other for a period of twenty days in a
conspicuous place on the front of the premises where the business is proposed
to be conducted, with a statement requiring any natural person who is a bona
fide resident residing or owning or leasing property within a one mile radius
from the premises proposed to be licensed, and who is in favor of or opposed to
the issuance of the license, to file written arguments in favor of or opposed
to the issuance of the license with the clerk within twenty days after the date
of posting. The posting shall be limited to a copy of the license application
and shall not contain any attachments filed with the application. The written
argument shall contain the natural person's complete name, street address or
post office box address and written or electronic signature. If the
written arguments are filed by a person on behalf of a corporation or other
legal entity or association, the written arguments must be accompanied by a
copy of the entity's organizing document, a designation of the office or
position that the person holds within the organization and a copy of the
written appointment of the person to speak on behalf of the organization. If
the written arguments are filed by a neighborhood association, block watch or
other unincorporated association, written arguments must be accompanied by a letter
of authority designating that person as a spokesperson. The posting shall contain substantially the
following:
Notice
A hearing on a liquor license application shall be held
before the local governing body at the following date, time and place:
(Insert date, time and address)
The local governing body will recommend to the state liquor
board whether the board should grant or deny the license. The state liquor
board may hold a hearing to consider the recommendation of the local governing
body.Any person residing or owning or leasing property within a onemile
radius may contact the state liquor board in writing to register as a
protestor. To request information regarding procedures before the board and
notice of any board hearings regarding this application, contact the state
liquor board at:
(Insert address and telephone number).
No arguments shall be filed or accepted by the
city or town clerk thereafter. This subsection shall not be construed to
prevent a bona fide resident residing or owning or leasing
property within a onemile radius from the premises proposed to be
licensed from testifying in favor of or in opposition to the issuance of the
license, regardless of whether or not the person is a user or nonuser of
spirituous liquor.
C.The governing body of the city, town or county
shall then enter an order recommending approval or disapproval within sixty
days after filing of the application and shall file a certified copy of the
order with the director.If the recommendation is for disapproval, a
statement of the specific reasons containing a summary of the testimony or
other evidence supporting the recommendation for disapproval shall be attached
to the order. All petitions submitted to the governing body within the twentyday
period for filing protests shall be transmitted to the director with the
certified copy of the order.
D.If a person applies for a license to conduct a
spirituous liquor business outside an incorporated city or town, the director
shall remit two copies of the application to the clerk of the board of
supervisors of the county where the applicant desires to do business, and the
proceedings by the clerk and board of supervisors shall be as provided for
cities and towns.
E.On receipt of an application for a spirituous
liquor license, the director shall set the application for hearing by the board
on a date following the expiration of the time fixed for the submitting of the
certified order by the governing body of the city or town or the board of
supervisors. If the city or town or the county recommends approval of the
license no hearing is required unless the director, the board or any aggrieved
party requests a hearing on the grounds that the public convenience and the
best interest of the community will not be substantially served if a license is
issued. Any natural person residing or owning or leasing property within a one
mile radius of the proposed location may file a written protest with the
director no later than fifteen calendar days following action by the local governing
body or sixty days after filing the application. The written argument shall
contain the natural person's complete name, street address or post office box
address and written or electronic signature. If the written arguments are
filed by a person on behalf of a corporation or other legal entity or
association, the written arguments must be accompanied by a copy of the
entity's organizing document, a designation of the office or position that the
person holds within the organization and a copy of the written appointment of
the person to speak on behalf of the organization.If the written
arguments are filed by a neighborhood association, block watch or other
unincorporated association, written arguments must be accompanied by a letter
of authority designating that person as a spokesperson. If no hearing is requested by the director,
the board or any aggrieved party, the application may be approved by the
director. If the recommendation is for disapproval of an application, the
board shall hold a hearing. If the city, town or county recommends approval of
the license pursuant to subsection C of this section or makes no
recommendation, the director may cancel the hearing and issue the license
unless the board or any aggrieved party requests a hearing.If the
reason for the protest is clearly removed or deemed satisfied by the director,
the board shall cancel the hearing.If the board cancels the
hearing, the department may administratively issue an order without the
applicant licensee or other parties present.The certified order,
the reasons contained in the order and the summary of the testimony and other
evidence supporting the city, town or county disapproval of the recommendation
shall be read into the record before the board and shall be considered as
evidence by the board.The board shall consider the certified order
together with other facts and a report of the director relating to the
qualifications of the applicant. If the governing body of the city or town or
the board of supervisors fails to return to the director, as provided in
subsections C and D of this section, its order of disapproval, no hearing is
required.An application shall be approved or disapproved within one
hundred five days after filing of the application. If, after a hearing by the
board where a license has been approved, a formal written order is not entered
within thirty days after the hearing, the decision of the board shall be deemed
entered on the thirtieth day after the hearing.
F.A hearing may be conducted by an administrative
law judge at the request of the board to make findings and recommendations for
use by the board in determining whether to grant or deny a license. The
administrative law judge shall submit a report of findings to the board within
twenty days of after the
hearing.The board may affirm, reverse, adopt, modify, supplement,
amend or reject the administrative law judge's report in whole or in part.
G.Except for a person to person transfer of a
transferable license for use at the same location and as otherwise provided in
section 4203, subsection A, in all proceedings before the governing body
of a city or town, the board of supervisors of a county or the board, the
applicant bears the burden of showing that the public convenience requires and
that the best interest of the community will be substantially served by the
issuance of a license.
H.In order to prevent the proliferation of
spirituous liquor licenses the department may deny a license to a business on
the grounds that such business is inappropriate for the sale of spirituous
liquor.An inappropriate business is one that cannot clearly
demonstrate that the sale of spirituous liquor is directly connected to its
primary purpose and that the sale of spirituous liquor is not merely incidental
to its primary purpose.
I.The board shall adopt, by rule, guidelines
setting forth criteria for use in determining whether the public convenience
requires and the best interest of the community will be substantially served by
the issuance or transfer of a liquor license at the location applied for.
These guidelines shall govern the recommendations and other approvals of the
department and the local governing authority.
J.If the governing body of a city or town
recommends disapproval by a twothirds vote of the members present and
voting on an application for the issuance or transfer of a spirituous liquor
license that, if approved, would result in a license being issued at a location
either having no license or having a license of a different series, the
application shall not be approved unless the board decides to approve the
application by a twothirds vote of the members present and voting.
K.Before
approving any application for a license to manufacture, sell or deal in
spirituous liquors within twentyfive miles of tribal land, the board
shall consult with the tribal council or governing body of the applicable
Indian tribe.In addition to the protests allowed under this section
and section 4203, a tribal council or governing body of an Indian tribe
may protest a spirituous liquor license application if the premises proposed to
be licensed is within twentyfive miles of tribal land. For the purposes
of this subsection:
1."Indian
tribe" means any organized Indian nation, tribe or community that is
recognized as an Indian tribe by the united States department of the interior.
2."Tribal
land" means all lands that are held in trust by the united states within
the limits of an area that is set aside by the United States for the exclusive
use and occupancy of Indian tribes by treaty, statute or executive order,
including land that is recognized as an Indian reservation by the United states
department of the interior. END_STATUTE
