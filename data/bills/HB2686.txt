definition
A.The board of
supervisors of each county shall annually,
at the time of levying other taxes, shall
annually levy school district taxes on the property in any school
district in which additional amounts are required, which shall be at rates
sufficient to provide the additional amounts.No delinquency factor
for estimated uncollected taxes may be included in the computation of the
primary tax rate for school district taxes.No local property taxes
may be levied for any deficit in the classroom site fund. The taxes shall be
added to and collected in the same manner as other county taxes on the property
within the school district.The amount of the school district taxes
levied upon on the property in a particular school
district shall be paid into the school fund of such
that school district.
B.At the same time of levying taxes as provided in
subsection A of this section, the county board of supervisors shall annually
levy an additional tax in each school district that is not eligible for
equalization assistance as provided in section 15971 in an amount
determined as follows:
1.Determine the levy that would be produced by
fifty per cent percent of the applicable
qualifying taxrate, prescribed in section 15971, subsection
B, per one hundred dollars assessed valuation.
2.Subtract the amount determined in section 15971,
subsection A from the levy determined in paragraph 1 of this
subsection.This difference is the additional amount levied or
collected as voluntary contributions pursuant to title 48, chapter 1, article
8, except that if the difference is zero or is a negative number, there shall
be no levy.
C.Monies collected pursuant to subsection B of this
section shall be transmitted to the state treasurer for deposit in the state
general fund to aid in school financial assistance.
D.The additional tax prescribed in subsection B of
this section is considered to be primary property tax for purposes of section
15972, subsection B, except that this state is not required to make the
payments prescribed in section 15972, subsection H for these reductions
in taxes.
E.A SCHOOL
DISTRICT that levies the qualifying tax rate specified in section 15-971, that
does not have a budget override in place and THAT IS SUBJECT TO THIS SECTION
MAY RETAIN A PORTION OF THE AMOUNT that is LEVIED BY THAT SCHOOL DISTRICT
PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION AND THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE TRANSMITTED TO THE STATE
GENERAL FUND IF THAT SCHOOL DISTRICT RECEIVES LESS THAN THE AVERAGE AMOUNT OF
FUNDING PER STUDENT RECEIVED BY AN ADJOINING SCHOOL DISTRICT FOR BUDGET
OVERRIDES APPROVED IN ELECTIONS CONDUCTED PURSUANT TO SECTION 15-481. THE
AMOUNT THAT MAY BE RETAINED BY THE SCHOOL DISTRICT PURSUANT TO THIS SUBSECTION
IS THE lowest AVERAGE AMOUNT RECEIVED PER PUPIL BY an ADJOINING SCHOOL DISTRICT
FOR BUDGET OVERRIDES APPROVED IN ELECTIONS CONDUCTED PURSUANT TO SECTION 15-481
MULTIPLIED BY THE STUDENT COUNT OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT, OR THE AMOUNT THAT
WOULD BE TRANSMITTED TO THE STATE UNDER THIS SECTION, WHICHEVER IS LESS. THE
REMAINDER OF THE AMOUNT LEVIED BY THE SCHOOL DISTRICT PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION
SHALL BE TRANSMITTED TO THE state treasurer for deposit in the STATE GENERAL
FUND. THE SCHOOL DISTRICT MAY INCREASE ITS BUDGET LIMITS BY THE ADDITIONAL
AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT IT IS ENTITLED TO RECEIVE UNDER THIS SECTION.

of this section, "assessed valuation" includes the values used to
determine voluntary contributions collected pursuant to title 9, chapter 4,
article 3 and title 48, chapter 1, article 8. END_STATUTE
