its highways:
1.A use fuel tax is imposed on use fuel used in the

same rate per gallon as the motor vehicle fuel tax prescribed in subsection A, paragraph 1 of this section,
except that there is no use fuel tax on alternative fuels.
2.A use fuel tax is imposed on use fuel used in the
propulsion of a use class motor vehicle on a highway in this state at the rate
of twentysix cents for each gallon, except that there is no use fuel tax
on alternative fuels and use class vehicles that are exempt pursuant to section
285432 from the weight fee prescribed in section 285433 are
subject to the use fuel tax imposed by paragraph 1 of this subsection.
3.Through December 31, 2024, a use fuel tax is
imposed on use fuel used in the propulsion of a motor vehicle transporting forest
products in compliance with the requirements of section 41-1516 on a highway in

4.A county
may levy by ordinance a tax on wholesale use fuel sold in the county not to

only to wholesale use fuel that is to be resold at retail.
C.The motor vehicle fuel and use fuel taxes imposed
pursuant to this section and the aviation fuel taxes imposed pursuant to
section 288344 are conclusively presumed to be direct taxes on the
consumer or user but shall be collected and remitted to the department by
suppliers for the purpose of convenience and facility only. Motor vehicle fuel,
use fuel and aviation fuel taxes that are collected and paid to the department
by a supplier are considered to be advance payments, shall be added to the
price of motor vehicle fuel, use fuel or aviation fuel and shall be recovered
from the consumer or user.
D.Motor vehicle fuel and use fuel taxes imposed
pursuant to this section on the use of motor vehicle fuel and use fuel and the
aviation fuel taxes imposed pursuant to section 288344 on the use of

invoiced gallons received outside this state at a refinery, terminal or bulk
plant for delivery to a destination in this state.

the bulk transfer terminal system or from a qualified terminal in this state.
3.Is removed, as measured by invoiced gallons, from
the bulk transfer terminal system or from a qualified terminal or refinery

precollection election pursuant to section 285636.
E.If motor fuel is removed from the bulk transfer
terminal system or from a qualified terminal or is imported into this state,
the original removal, transfer or importation of the motor fuel is subject to
the collection of the tax.If this motor fuel is transported to
another qualified terminal or reenters the bulk transfer terminal system, the
subsequent sale of the motor fuel on which tax has been collected is not
subject to collection of an additional tax if proper documentation is retained
to support the transaction. END_STATUTE
