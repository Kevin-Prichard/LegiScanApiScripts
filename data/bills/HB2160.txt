or 38922 shall either:
1.Make payments directly to ASRS as provided in
subsection H of this section.
2.Elect to have the member's employer make payments
as provided in subsection B of this section.
B.A member may elect to have the member's employer
make payments for all or any portion of the amounts payable for the member's
purchase of credited service pursuant to the sections prescribed in subsection
A of this section through a salary reduction program in accordance with the
following:
1.The amounts paid pursuant to a salary reduction
program are in lieu of contributions by the electing member.The
electing member's salary or other compensation shall be reduced by the amount
paid by the employer pursuant to this subsection.For the purposes
of this paragraph, "other compensation" includes a member's
termination pay.
2.The member shall make an election pursuant to
this subsection at any time on or after the date the member elects to purchase
credited service pursuant to the sections prescribed in subsection A of this
section and before the member's termination of employment. The election shall
specify the number of payroll periods that deductions will be made from the
member's compensation and the dollar amount of deductions for each payroll
period during the specified number of payroll periods. In the case of an
election to utilize all or any part of the member's termination pay to purchase
credited service, the member's election shall be made at least three full
calendar months before the date of the member's termination of employment and entitlement
to receive the termination pay.After an election is made pursuant
to this subsection, the election is binding on and irrevocable for the member
and the member's employer during the member's remaining period of current
employment. After a member makes an irrevocable election pursuant to this
subsection, the member does not have the option of choosing to receive the

elections pursuant to this subsection may also make other contributions to ASRS
pursuant to subsection H of this section to the extent of any remaining amounts
payable for which the member has not made an election pursuant to this
subsection. An additional election or contribution with respect to a portion
of the amounts payable for the member's purchase of credited service does not

subsection for any other portion of the amounts payable for the member's
purchase of credited service.
4.If on termination of the member's employment with
an ASRS employer all amounts have not been paid to ASRS pursuant to the
member's irrevocable election pursuant to this subsection, the member may pay
ASRS, within thirty days after the member's termination of employment and
subject to other limitations prescribed in this section, all or any portion of
the unpaid amounts as provided in subsection H of this section. These payments

this subsection with respect to any amount to be paid by the member's employer
while the member is employed by the member's employer.

employer pursuant to this subsection shall be treated as employer contributions
for the purpose of determining tax treatment under the internal revenue code.

included in the member's gross income for income tax purposes until those
amounts are distributed by refund or retirement benefit payments.
6.Unless otherwise provided, member contributions
paid by an employer pursuant to this subsection are treated for all other
purposes under ASRS in the same manner and to the same extent as member
contributions that are not paid by an employer pursuant to this
subsection.ASRS shall not grant credited service for contributions
made pursuant to this subsection until those contributions are received by
ASRS.ASRS may assess interest or administrative charges attributable
to any salary reduction election made pursuant to this subsection. The
interest or administrative charges shall be added to the amount of
contributions that is made to ASRS by the member each payroll period and that
is paid by the member's employer. The interest or administrative charges shall
not be treated as member contributions for any purposes under this article and
a member or a member's beneficiary does not have a right to the return of the
interest or administrative charges pursuant to any other provision of this
article. Interest assessed pursuant to this subsection shall be at the rate
specified by the board pursuant to section 38711, paragraph 2.
7.If a member transfers employment from one
participating employer with which the member has made an irrevocable election
pursuant to this subsection to another participating employer, the member and

irrevocable election that the member made with the original participating employer.
C.A member who elects before July 1, 1999 to
receive retirement benefits based on section 38771, subsection C,
paragraph 2 or a member who elects to make contributions to ASRS pursuant to
section 38771.01, subsection F, paragraph 4 shall either make the

paragraph 4 directly to ASRS as provided in subsection H of this section or
shall elect to have the member's employer make payments for those additional
contributions as provided in subsection D of this section. A member who
elected to be covered or who was deemed to be covered by section 38771
on or before December 31, 1995 or who elects to make member contributions
pursuant to section 38771.01, subsection F, paragraph 3 is deemed to
have made an irrevocable election pursuant to subsection D of this section to

salary reduction program in accordance with the following:
1.A member may make member contributions pursuant
to section 38771, subsection E or section 38771.01, subsection F,
paragraph 4 through a salary reduction program elected pursuant to this subsection.

contributions pursuant to section 38771, subsection E, the election
continues in effect from and after June 30, 1999 and shall not be revoked,

member may make an election pursuant to this subsection at any time after the

member elects to make member contributions pursuant to section 38771.01,
subsection F, paragraph 4. The election shall specify the number of payroll
periods that deductions will be made from the member's compensation and the

irrevocable election pursuant to this subsection, the member does not have the

employer make payments for less than all of the amounts payable for the member's
additional contributions allowed by section 38771.01, subsection F,
paragraph 4 may irrevocably elect to have the member's employer make payments
for all or any portion of the remaining amounts payable for the member's
additional contributions.A member who makes one or more irrevocable
elections pursuant to this subsection may also make other contributions to ASRS
pursuant to section 38771.01, subsection F, paragraph 4 or pursuant to
subsection H of this section to the extent of any remaining amounts payable for
which the member has not made an election pursuant to this subsection. An
additional election or contribution with respect to a portion of the amounts
payable for the member's additional contributions pursuant to section 38771.01,
subsection F, paragraph 4 does not alter, amend or revoke an irrevocable
election already made pursuant to this subsection for any other portion of the
amounts payable for the member's additional contributions allowed by section 38771.01,
subsection F, paragraph 4.
4.If on termination of the member's employment all
amounts have not been paid to ASRS pursuant to the member's irrevocable
election pursuant to this subsection, the member may pay ASRS, within thirty
days after the member's termination of employment and subject to other
limitations prescribed in this section, all or any portion of the unpaid
amounts as provided in subsection H of this section. These payments do not
alter, amend or revoke any irrevocable election already made pursuant to this
subsection with respect to any amount to be paid by the member's employer while
the member is employed by the member's employer.
5.Amounts paid by an employer pursuant to this
subsection shall be treated as employer contributions for the purpose of
determining tax treatment under the internal revenue code. The effective date
of employer payments pursuant to this subsection shall not be before the date
ASRS receives notification from the United States internal revenue service that
pursuant to section 414(h)(2) of the internal revenue code the amounts paid by
an employer pursuant to this subsection will not be included in the member's
gross income for income tax purposes until those amounts are distributed by
refund or retirement benefit payments.
6.Unless otherwise provided, member contributions
paid by an employer pursuant to this subsection are treated for all other
purposes under ASRS in the same manner and to the same extent as member
contributions that are not paid by an employer pursuant to this subsection.
7.If a member transfers employment from one
participating employer with which the member has made an irrevocable election
pursuant to this subsection to another participating employer, the member and
the successor participating employer shall complete the terms of the
irrevocable election that the member made with the original participating
employer.
E.The following
limits apply to contributions to ASRS:
1.Except to the extent paragraphs 2 and 3 of this
subsection apply to certain contributions made by a member to ASRS and to the
extent permitted under section 414(v) of the internal revenue code, if
applicable, in any one limitation year, the annual additions contributed or
allocated to ASRS for or on behalf of a member shall not exceed the lesser of either:
(a)Forty thousand dollars or a larger amount that
is prescribed by the board and that is due to any cost of living adjustment
announced by the United States secretary of the treasury pursuant to section
415(d) of the internal revenue code. The board shall increase the amount
prescribed by this subdivision as of the effective date of the increase
announced by the United States secretary of the treasury.
(b)One hundred per cent
percent of the member's compensation for the limitation year.
The compensation limit prescribed in this subdivision does not apply to any
contribution to ASRS for medical benefits after a member's separation from
service, within the meaning prescribed in section 401(h) or 419A(f)(2) of the
internal revenue code, that is otherwise treated as an annual addition.
2.Unless paragraph 4 of this subsection applies,
for plan years beginning on or after July 1, 1998, in any one limitation year,
the annual additions credited to ASRS for or on behalf of a member who makes
contributions to ASRS to purchase credited service pursuant to section 38743,
38744, 38745 or 38922 and with respect to which an
irrevocable election has not been made pursuant to subsection B of this section
shall not exceed the greater of either:
(a)The requirements of section 38769. For
the purposes of applying the limits prescribed in section 38769 under
this subdivision, the accrued benefit derived from the contributions shall be
treated as an annual benefit and the reduced limit for certain early retirement
in section 38769, subsection C, paragraph 2 does not apply.
(b)Except as provided in paragraph 3 of this
subsection, the requirements of paragraph 1 of this subsection. The
contributions shall be treated as annual additions and any of the member's
other annual additions for the limitation year shall be taken into
account.For the purposes of applying the requirements of paragraph
1 of this subsection under this subdivision, the percentage of compensation
limit in paragraph 1, subdivision (b) of this paragraph does not apply.
3.For plan years beginning on or after July 1,
1998, the requirements of paragraph 1 of this subsection shall not be applied
to reduce the amount of credited service that may be purchased by an eligible
member pursuant to section 38743, 38744, 38745 or 38922
to an amount that is less than the amount of credited service allowed to be
purchased pursuant to those sections on August 5, 1997 without the application
of any of the limits prescribed in this section or section 415 of the internal
revenue code. For the purposes of this paragraph, "eligible member"
means a person who first becomes a member of ASRS before July 1, 1999.
4.Member contributions to ASRS to purchase credited
service pursuant to section 38743, 38744 or 38922 shall
not be made by a member if recognition of that service would cause a member to
receive a retirement benefit for the same service from ASRS and one or more
other retirement plans. This paragraph does not apply to either of the
following:
(a)Contributions made by an eligible member as
defined in paragraph 3 of this subsection, except that any service purchase by
an eligible member is subject to any other limitations, including limitations
on duplicative service purchase, otherwise provided in this article.
(b)Any member contributions with respect to which
an irrevocable election has been made by a member pursuant to subsection B of
this section, except that the service purchase is subject to any other
limitations, including limitations on duplicative service purchase, otherwise
provided in this article.
F.If a member's contributions are subject to the
limitations of subsection E of this section, the contributions shall be treated
as being made to a separate defined contribution plan. If the member's
contributions exceed the limits prescribed in subsection E of this section when
taking into account other member and employer contributions to ASRS on behalf
of the member for the limitation year, the amount to be paid by the member
shall be reduced to not exceed the limits prescribed in subsection E of this
section and the remaining amount shall be carried forward to the next
limitation year, unless the limits are exceeded in the next limitation
year.If the limits are exceeded in the next limitation year, the
procedure prescribed by this subsection shall be repeated until all payments
have been made.
G.If, after the application of subsection F of this
section, the annual additions on behalf of a member exceed the limitations
prescribed in subsection E of this section, ASRS shall dispose of excess
amounts by either of the following:
1.Returning to the member any contributions that
are made by the member and that are nondeductible under the internal revenue
code.
2.Holding the amounts in a suspense account
established pursuant to subsection L of this section and allocating the amounts
as either member or employer contributions for the benefit of the member in the
next limitation year and before any further member or employer contributions are
made that would constitute annual additions made to a defined contribution plan
pursuant to section 415 of the internal revenue code. ASRS shall allocate
contributions as prescribed in this section, and the amount allocated shall
reduce the amount of the member or employer contributions for the limitation
year in which the allocation is made.
H.To the extent that a payment under this
subsection does not alter, amend or revoke any one or more currently effective
irrevocable elections made by the member pursuant to subsection B or D of this
section, the board may accept contributions made pursuant to section 38771
or member contributions for the payment for credited service purchases pursuant
to section 38738, 38742, 38743, 38744, 38745
or 38922 or contributions made pursuant to section 38771.01,
subsection F, paragraph 4, in whole or in part, by any one or a combination of
the following methods:
1.In lump sum payments.
2.Subject to the limitations prescribed in sections
401(a)(31) and 402(c) of the internal revenue code and subsection J of this
section, accepting a direct transfer of any eligible rollover distribution or a contribution by a member of an eligible
rollover distribution from one or more:
(a)Retirement programs that are qualified under

or a political subdivision of a state.
3.Subject to
the limitations prescribed in section 408(d)(3)(A)(ii) of the internal revenue
code, accepting from a member a rollover contribution of that portion of a
distribution from an individual retirement account or individual retirement
annuity described in section 408(a) or 408(b) of the internal revenue code that
is eligible to be rolled over and would otherwise be includable as gross
income.
3.Accepting
from a member a direct transfer from an individual retirement account or
individual retirement annuity described in section 408(a) or 408(b) of the internal revenue code of an amount that would
otherwise be eligible to be rolled over to ASRS under the provisions of section
408(d)(3)(A)(ii) of the internal revenue code if the amount
had been received by the member and would have otherwise been includible in the
member's gross income but for the direct transfer.
4.Providing by rule that the contributions may be
made in installment payments over a period of time.
I.To the extent that a payment under this
subsection does not alter, amend or revoke any one or more currently effective
irrevocable elections made by a member pursuant to subsection B or D of this
section, the board may accept a direct trusteetotrustee transfer
from retirement programs that are qualified under section 401(a) or 403(a) of
the internal revenue code, an annuity contract described in section 403(b) of
the internal revenue code or an eligible deferred compensation plan described
in section 457(b) of the internal revenue code for the payment for credited
service purchases pursuant to section 38742, 38743, 38744,
38745 or 38922.If a direct trusteetotrustee
transfer is from a retirement program that is qualified under section 401(a) of
the internal revenue code and that includes a cash or deferred arrangement
described in section 401(k) of the internal revenue code, the member on whose
behalf the transfer was made is not eligible to retire under section 38764,
subsection I before the date the member attains fifty-nine and onehalf
years of age.
J.ASRS shall separately account for all amounts
rolled over or directly transferred to ASRS. Subject to the limitations
contained in the internal revenue code applicable to the type of plan from
which an eligible rollover distribution is transferred, to the extent any
eligible rollover distribution that is directly transferred to ASRS consists wholly
or partially of amounts that would otherwise not be included in the member's
gross income if not so transferred, ASRS shall separately account for the
amounts so transferred, and earnings on those amounts, including separately
accounting for the portion of the amount that is includable in gross income and
the portion of the amount that is not includable in gross income.
K.ASRS shall not grant credited service under
section 38738, 38742, 38743, 38744 or 38922

charges attributable to any installment payment made pursuant to subsection H,
paragraph 4 of this section to purchase credited service pursuant to section 38738,
38742, 38743, 38744 or 38922. The interest or
administrative charges shall be added to the amount of contributions made to
ASRS by the member. The interest or administrative charges shall not be
treated as member contributions for any purposes under this article, and a
member or a member's beneficiary does not have a right to the return of the
interest or administrative charges pursuant to any other provision of this
article. Interest assessed pursuant to this subsection shall be at the rate
specified by the board pursuant to section 38711, paragraph 2.
L.Notwithstanding any provision of this article to
the contrary, if the annual additions credited on behalf of an ASRS member
during any limitation year exceed the limits of section 415(c) of the internal
revenue code and subsection E of this section, ASRS may only correct the excess
pursuant to the employee plans compliance resolution system prescribed in
internal revenue service revenue procedure 200850 or any future guidance
issued by the internal revenue service, including the preamble of the final
treasury regulations issued under section 415 of the internal revenue code.
M.If the member retires before all payments are
made pursuant to this section, ASRS shall calculate the member's benefits based
only on the payments actually made.
N.On satisfaction of the requirements of this
section, ASRS shall adjust the member's credited service history and add any
additional service credits acquired.
O.Annual additions on behalf of a member in any
limitation year shall be the sum of:
1.The amount of the member contributions made to
ASRS to purchase credited service pursuant to section 38738, 38743,
38744, 38745 or 38922 and with respect to which an
irrevocable election made pursuant to subsection B of this section is not in
effect.
2.The amount of member and employer contributions
made to ASRS on behalf of a member who elected or was deemed to have elected to
receive retirement benefits pursuant to section 38771 or who is entitled
to benefits pursuant to section 38771.01, except that, other than as
provided in subsection P of this section, corrective contributions shall be
considered annual additions for the limitation years to which the contributions
relate and interest and gains shall not be considered as annual additions for
the purpose of any limitation prescribed in this article or in section 415 of
the internal revenue code. If the corrective contributions exceed the limit on
annual additions for a limitation year prior to the limitation year in which
the corrective contributions are contributed by the employer to ASRS, the
retirement benefit attributable to the excess corrective contributions shall be
treated as an excess benefit and shall be payable to the member as any other
excess benefit is payable pursuant to section 38774, and the employer
shall pay the excess corrective contributions to the separate unfunded
governmental excess benefit arrangement administered by the board pursuant to
section 38774.
3.Any member or employer contributions made to ASRS
or any other plan that are treated as being made to a defined contribution plan
maintained by an employer of the member.
4.Any forfeitures, including any income
attributable to forfeitures, allocated for or on behalf of a member of ASRS or
any other plan that are treated as being allocated under a defined contribution
plan maintained by an employer of the member.
P.To the extent any portion of the subject
benefits, if treated as subject to the benefit limitations of section 415(b) of
the internal revenue code, exceed the applicable limitation on benefits
pursuant to section 38769 for the form of distribution, a percentage of
corrective contributions and interest and gains shall be treated as annual
additions for the limitation year in which contributed by the employer to
ASRS.This percentage of corrective contributions and interest and
gains shall be equal to the percentage determined by dividing the subject
benefits that exceed the limitation on benefits pursuant to section 38769
by the subject benefits. If the corrective contributions and interest and
gains that are treated as annual additions for the limitation year in which the
corrective contributions and interest and gains are contributed by the employer
to ASRS exceed the limit on annual additions for the limitation year, the
retirement benefit attributable to the excess shall be treated as an excess
benefit and shall be payable to the member as any other excess benefit is
payable pursuant to section 38774, and the employer shall pay the excess
to the separate unfunded governmental excess benefit arrangement administered
by the board pursuant to section 38774.
Q.Subsection O of this section shall be construed
and interpreted in accordance with section 415 of the internal revenue code and
the final treasury regulations issued under that section.
R.For the purposes of this section:
1."Compensation" has the same meaning
prescribed in section 38769.
2."Corrective contributions" means any
contributions that are paid by an employer pursuant to section 38771.01,
subsection C, paragraph 3 and that are attributable to employer contributions
that should have been made for prior limitation years.
3."Defined contribution plan" has the
same meaning prescribed in section 38769.
4."Eligible rollover distribution" has
the same meaning prescribed in section 38770.
5."Interest and gains" means employer
contributions to ASRS pursuant to section 38771.01, subsection C,
paragraphs 3, 5 and 6 that are attributable to earnings and supplemental
credits that would have been earned or added to a member's annuity payment.
6."Limitation year" has the same meaning
prescribed in section 38769.
7."Participating employer" means an
employer that participates in ASRS.
8."Subject benefits" means the retirement
benefit received by a member pursuant to section 38771.01 minus the sum
of the portion of such retirement benefit attributable to contributions that
were made by or on behalf of the member to the defined contribution program
administered by ASRS for periods before July 1, 1981 and contributions that
were made by the member after June 30, 1981 and that were not picked up as
provided in section 414(h)(2) of the internal revenue code. END_STATUTE
