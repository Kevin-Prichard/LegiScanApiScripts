START_STATUTE231422.Nonunion employees; payment of representation expenses
A.If an employee is a member of a collective bargaining
unit of an employer with which a labor organization has a contract but the
employee is not a member of the labor organization, that contract may provide
that the employee is liable to the labor organization for the actual costs of
grievance representation incurred by the labor organization in representing the
employee in any grievance process initiated by the employee, except that the
employee is not liable for costs that exceed an amount equal to the dues of a
member of the labor organization during the period of the most recent
contract. An employee may reimburse the labor organization for these costs by
making monthly payments equal to normal monthly membership dues until the
entire amount owed has been paid.
B.If the employee fails to begin reimbursing the labor
organization for the costs within thirty days after the final decision in the
grievance process, the labor organization may bring an action in a court of
competent jurisdiction for payment of the costs of
representation.Failure to reimburse the costs does not prejudice
the right of the employee to continued employment with the employer.
C.This section does not prohibit an employee who is not
a member of the labor organization from representing himself or from retaining
legal counsel in any grievance process. END_STATUTE
