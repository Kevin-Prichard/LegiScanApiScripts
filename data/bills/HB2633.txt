A.The governing board at any time may employ and
fix the salaries and benefits of employees necessary for the succeeding

writing, and all employees shall be employed subject to section 38481.The
governing board may transmit and receive contracts of certificated employees in
an electronic format and may accept electronic signatures on those contracts.
If a contract has not been transmitted to the certificated employee by the end
of the current school year, the transmittal of an electronic contract to that
certificated employee prior to the start of the next school year shall be
submitted to both the certificated employee's school district e-mail address as well as the
certificated employee's personal e-mail address
in order to notify them
the employee of the offer
of contract.Each certificated employee shall be responsible for
submitting his or her the employee's personal e-mail address to human resources
personnel at the school district for this purpose. Documents transmitted in an
electronic format pursuant to this subsection shall be considered written
documents for the purposes of sections 15536 and 15538.01.The
governing board may adopt requirements that require electronic signatures to be
followed by original signatures within a specified time period.A
governing board that accepts an electronic signature for a certificated
employee's contract shall provide validation to the certificated employee that
the contract has been transmitted.The governing board may obtain
the services of any employee, including teachers, substitute teachers and
administrators, by contracting with a private entity that employs personnel
required by the school district. The
governing board shall adopt and administer personnel policies that provide
noncertificated personnel with substantially equivalent due process procedures
as those prescribed in this chapter for certificated teachers.
B.A teacher shall not be employed if the teacher
has not received a certificate for teaching granted by the proper
authorities.If a teacher has filed an application and completed all
of the requirements for a certificate but time does not allow a teacher to receive
a certificate before the commencement of employment, the conditional
certificate shall serve as a certificate for the payment of wages, provided
that the teacher files the conditional certificate with the county school
superintendent and the certificate is issued within three months of the date of
commencing employment.In order to be paid wages beyond the
three-month period prescribed in this subsection, the teacher shall file the
certificate with the county school superintendent. Any contract issued to a teacher
who has completed certificate requirements but has not received a certificate
shall be specifically contingent on receipt of such a
certificate.The governing board of a school district that is
subject to section 15914.01 shall adhere to the duties described in
section 15302, subsection A, paragraph 9 for purposes of this
subsection.

of a governing board member may be employed in the school district in which the
person to whom such dependent is so related is a governing board member, except
by consent of the board.
D.The governing board may employ certificated
teachers under contract as parttime classroom
teachers.Notwithstanding any other statute, a certificated teacher
who has been employed by the school district for more than the major portion of
three consecutive school years does not lose the entitlement to the procedures
prescribed in sections 15538.01, 15539 through 15544 and
15547 if the teacher is employed under contract on a parttime
basis for at least forty per cent
percent time.For
the purposes of this subsection, "forty per cent percent time" means employed for at least forty per cent percent of the school day required of fulltime
teachers of the same grade level or for at least forty per cent percent of the class load assigned to fulltime
teachers of the same grade level, as determined by the governing board.
E.The governing board may employ a business manager
who has expertise in finance. For the purposes of this subsection,
"expertise in finance" means one or more of the following:
1.A baccalaureate degree in accounting, finance,
school finance or public finance.
2.A graduate degree in accounting, finance, school
finance or public finance.
3.Other finance training or finance experience that
the governing board determines is sufficient to qualify the person to
administer the business operations of the school district.

if an employee is discharged from the service of a school district, the school
district shall pay the wages due to the employee within ten calendar days from
the date of discharge.
