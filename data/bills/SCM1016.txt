A CONCURRENT MEMORIAL

Urging the United
States Congress to oppose the implementation of certain rules for existing
electric utility generating units.


(TEXT OF BILL BEGINS ON NEXT PAGE)





To the Congress of the United States of America:
Your memorialist respectfully represents:
Whereas, the Clean Air Act (CAA) is a federal law designed to
protect air quality nationwide; and
Whereas, jurisdiction to implement the CAA lies primarily with
the states; and
Whereas, in 1970, Congress enacted the CAA, mandating
comprehensive state and federal regulations for both stationary and
nonstationary sources of pollution; and
Whereas, while Americans support efforts to improve air
quality, such efforts should be carefully balanced to ensure that the cost of
new regulations on the economy do not exceed potential benefits; and
Whereas, on October 23, 2015, the United States Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) published final rules in the Federal Register
regulating greenhouse gas emissions from existing electric utility generating
units, also known as the Clean Power Plan; and
Whereas, the EPA has issued a proposed federal plan that will
be imposed on existing electric utility generating units in the State of
Arizona if the State of Arizona does not adopt its own plan implementing the
Clean Power Plan regulating greenhouse gas emissions; and
Whereas, the EPA's Clean Power Plan exceeds the agency's legal
authority to require reductions in carbon dioxide emissions from existing
fossil fuelfired electric generating units under Section 111(d) of the
CAA and interferes with the electric system of Arizona; and
Whereas, addressing greenhouse gas emissions under Section
111(d) is a discretionary duty of the EPA as outlined in the CAA; and
Whereas, devoting resources to discretionary duties like
regulating greenhouse gas emissions takes resources away from nondiscretionary
duties that are better suited to protect the public health and safety in the
near term; and
Whereas, it is important to Arizona's economy to have a diverse
energy portfolio that provides reliable and affordable electric service to
Arizona residents and businesses while also protecting the public health and
safety; and
Whereas, fossil fuels, including coal and natural gas, provide
an abundant and affordable domestic energy source that is important to
Arizona's economy and enhance the availability and reliability of electric
service; and
Whereas, the EPA's final Clean Power Plan impedes the ability
of this state to oversee its own electricity supply and transmission system;
and
Whereas, the EPA's Clean Power Plan will have adverse impacts
on the customs, culture, history, heritage and economies of this state and
local communities.
Wherefore your memorialist, the Senate of the State of Arizona, the
House of Representatives concurring, prays:
1.That
the United States Congress oppose the implementation of rules for existing
electric utility generating units that exceed the EPA's legal authority under
Section 111(d) of the CAA and interfere with the prerogative of Arizona to
regulate electricity and ensure an affordable and reliable supply of
electricity for its citizens.
2.That the United
States Congress oppose the implementation of rules for existing electric
utility generating units that do not recognize the primary role of states in
establishing and implementing plans to achieve emissions reductions for
existing units under Section 111(d) of the CAA.
3.That the United
States Congress exercise oversight over the EPA to ensure that the primary role
of states in establishing and implementing plans to achieve emissions reductions
from existing electric utility generating units under Section 111(d) of the CAA
is respected.
4.That the Governor and
the Attorney General of the State of Arizona take appropriate actions to uphold
this state's responsibilities with respect to the CAA and defend this state
against overreaching regulations.
5.That the Secretary of
State of the State of Arizona transmit a copy of this Memorial to the President
of the United States, the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of
the United States House of Representatives, each Member of Congress from the
State of Arizona, the Administrator of the United States Environmental
Protection Agency, the Governor of the State of Arizona and the Attorney
General of the State of Arizona.
