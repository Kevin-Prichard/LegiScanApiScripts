(c)If both subdivisions (a) and (b) of this
paragraph apply to a unified school district, its limit for the purposes of
this paragraph is the combination of its elementary limit and its secondary
limit.
(d)If only subdivision (a) or (b) of this paragraph
applies to a unified school district, the district's limit for the purposes of
this paragraph is the sum of the limit computed as provided in subdivision (a)
or (b) of this paragraph plus ten per
cent percent of
the revenue control limit attributable to those grade levels that do not meet
the eligibility requirements of this subsection. If
a school district budgets monies outside the revenue control limit pursuant to
section 15949, subsection E, the
district's limit for the purposes of this paragraph is only the ten per cent
percent of the revenue control limit attributable to those grade
levels that are not included under section 15949, subsection E.For the purposes of this subdivision,
the revenue control limit is separated into elementary and secondary components
based on the weighted student count as provided in section 15971,
subsection B, paragraph 2, subdivision (a).
2.If a school district utilizes this subsection to
request an override of more than one year, the ballot shall include an estimate
of the amount of the proposed increase in the future years in place of the

fully funded by a levy of taxes on the taxable property within the school
district, the ballot shall contain the words "budget increase, yes"
and "budget increase, no", and the voter shall signify the voter's
desired choice.The ballot shall also contain the amount of the
proposed increase of the budget over the alternate budget, a statement that the

district's revenue control limit in future years, if applicable, as provided in
subsection Q of this section, and the following statement:
Any budget increase authorized by this election shall be
entirely funded by a levy of taxes on the taxable property within this school
district for the year for which adopted and for _____ subsequent years, shall
not be realized from monies furnished by the state and shall not be subject to
the limitation on taxes specified in article IX, section 18, Constitution of
Arizona.Based on the current net assessed valuation used for
secondary property tax purposes, to fund the proposed increase in the school
district's budget which will be funded by a levy of taxes upon the taxable
property within this school district would require an estimated tax rate of
__________ dollar per one hundred dollars of net assessed valuation used for
secondary property tax purposes and is in addition to the school district's tax
rate that will be levied to fund the school district's revenue control limit
allowed by law.

fully funded by revenues other than a levy of taxes on the taxable property
within the school district, the ballot shall contain the words "budget
increase, yes" and "budget increase, no", and the voter shall
signify the voter's desired choice. The ballot shall also contain the amount

and authorized as provided in subsection I or J of this section, or a
combination of both of these subsections, is five per cent percent of the revenue control limit as provided in section
15947, subsection A for the budget year. For a common school district
not within a high school district or a common school district within a high
school district that offers instruction in high school subjects as provided in
section 15447, five per cent
percent of the revenue
control limit means five per cent
percent of the revenue
control limit attributable to the weighted student count in preschool programs
for children with disabilities, kindergarten programs and grades one through
eight as provided in section 15971, subsection B. For a unified school
district, five per cent percent of the revenue control
limit means five per cent percent of the revenue control
limit attributable to the weighted student count in preschool programs for
children with disabilities, kindergarten programs and grades one through
twelve. For a union high school district, five per cent percent of the revenue control limit means five per cent percent of the revenue control limit
attributable to the weighted student count in grades nine through twelve.

assistance and if the proposed increase will be fully funded by a levy of taxes
upon on the taxable property within the school
district, the ballot shall contain the words "budget increase, yes"

Any budget increase authorized by this election shall be
entirely funded by a levy of taxes upon the taxable property within this school
district for the year in which adopted and for _____ subsequent years, shall
not be realized from monies furnished by the state and shall not be subject to
the limitation on taxes specified in article IX, section 18, Constitution of
Arizona.Based on the current net assessed valuation used for
secondary property tax purposes, to fund the proposed increase in the school
district's budget would require an estimated tax rate of _______________ dollar
per one hundred dollars of net assessed valuation used for secondary property
tax purposes and is in addition to the school district's tax rate which will be
levied to fund the school district's district additional assistance allowed by
law.
M.If the election is
to exceed district additional assistance and if the proposed increase will be
fully funded by revenues from other than a levy of taxes upon on
the taxable property within the school district, the ballot shall
contain the words "budget increase, yes" and "budget increase,
no", and the voter shall signify the voter's desired choice. An election
held pursuant to this subsection shall be held on the first Tuesday after the
first Monday of November. The ballot shall also contain the amount of the
proposed increase of the proposed budget over the alternate budget and the

revenue control limit as provided in subsection E or F of this section, the

district additional assistance as provided in subsection L or M of this
section, the ballot shall be prepared so that the voters may vote on each
proposed increase separately and shall contain statements required in the same
manner as if each proposed increase were submitted separately.
O.If the election provides for a levy of taxes on
the taxable property within the school district, at least thirty days prior to
the election, the department of revenue shall provide the school district
governing board and the county school superintendent with the current net
assessed valuation of the school district.The governing board and
the county school superintendent shall use the current net assessed valuation
of the school district to translate the amount of the proposed dollar increase
in the budget of the school district over that allowed by law into a tax rate
figure.
P.If the voters in a school district vote to adopt
a budget in excess of the revenue control limit as provided in subsection E or
F of this section, any additional increase shall be included in the aggregate
budget limit for each of the years authorized. Any additional increase shall
be excluded from the determination of equalization assistance.The
school district governing board, however, may levy on the net assessed
valuation used for secondary property tax purposes of the property in the
school district the additional increase if adopted under subsection E of this
section for the period of one year, two years or five through seven years as
authorized. If an additional increase is approved as provided in subsection F
of this section, the school district governing board may only use revenues
derived from the school district's prior year's maintenance and operation fund
ending cash balance to fund the additional increase.If a budget
increase was previously authorized and will be in effect for the budget year or
budget year and subsequent years, as provided in subsection E or F of this
section, the governing board may request a new budget increase as provided in
the same subsection under which the prior budget increase was adopted, which
shall not exceed the maximum amount permitted under subsection G of this
section.If the voters in the school district authorize the new
budget increase amount, the existing budget increase no longer is in effect.
If the voters in the school district do not authorize the budget increase
amount, the existing budget increase remains in effect for the time period for
which it was authorized. The maximum additional increase authorized as
provided in subsection E or F of this section and the additional increase that
is included in the aggregate budget limit is based on a percentage of a school
district's revenue control limit in future years, if the budget increase is
authorized for more than one year. If the additional increase:
1.Is for two years, the proposed increase in the
second year is equal to the initial proposed percentage increase.
2.Is for five years or more, the proposed increase
is equal to the initial proposed percentage increase in the following years of
the proposed increase, except that in the next to last year it is twothirds
of the initial proposed percentage increase and it is onethird of the
initial proposed percentage increase in the last year of the proposed increase.
Q.If the voters in a school district vote to adopt
a budget in excess of the revenue control limit as provided in subsection I or
J of this section, any additional increase shall be included in the aggregate
budget limit for each of the years authorized. Any additional increase shall
be excluded from the determination of equalization assistance.The
school district governing board, however, may levy on the net assessed
valuation used for secondary property tax purposes of the property in the
school district the additional increase if adopted under subsection I of this
section for the period of one year, two years or five through seven years as
authorized. If an additional increase is approved as provided in subsection J
of this section, the increase may only be budgeted and expended if sufficient
monies are available in the maintenance and operation fund of the school
district. If a budget increase was previously authorized and will be in effect
for the budget year or budget year and subsequent years, as provided in
subsection I or J of this section, the governing board may request a new budget
increase as provided in the same subsection under which the prior budget
increase was adopted that does not exceed the maximum amount permitted under
subsection K of this section. If the voters in the school district authorize
the new budget increase amount, the existing budget increase no longer is in
effect. If the voters in the school district do not authorize the budget
increase amount, the existing budget increase remains in effect for the time
period for which it was authorized.The maximum additional increase
authorized as provided in subsection I or J of this section and the additional
increase that is included in the aggregate budget limit is based on a
percentage of a school district's revenue control limit in future years, if the
budget increase is authorized for more than one year. If the additional
increase:
1.Is for two years, the proposed increase in the
second year is equal to the initial proposed percentage increase.
2.Is for five years or more, the proposed increase
is equal to the initial proposed percentage increase in the following years of
the proposed increase, except that in the next to last year it is twothirds
of the initial proposed percentage increase and it is onethird of the
initial proposed percentage increase in the last year of the proposed increase.
R.If the voters in a school district vote to adopt
a budget in excess of district additional assistance as provided in subsection
L of this section, any additional increase shall be included in the aggregate
budget limit for each of the years authorized. The additional increase shall
be excluded from the determination of equalization assistance.The
school district governing board, however, may levy on the net assessed valuation
used for secondary property tax purposes of the property in the school district
the additional increase for the period authorized but not to exceed ten years.
For overrides approved by a vote of the qualified electors of the school
district at an election held from and after October 31, 1998, the period of the
additional increase prescribed in this subsection shall not exceed seven years
for any capital override election.
S.If the voters in a school district vote to adopt
a budget in excess of district additional assistance as provided in subsection
M of this section, any additional increase shall be included in the aggregate
budget limit for each of the years authorized. The additional increase shall
be excluded from the determination of equalization assistance.The
school district governing board may only use revenues derived from the school
district's prior year's maintenance and operation fund ending cash balance and
capital outlay fund ending cash balance to fund the additional increase for the
period authorized but not to exceed ten years. For overrides approved by a
vote of the qualified electors of the school district at an election held from
and after October 31, 1998, the period of the additional increase prescribed in
this subsection shall not exceed seven years for any capital override election.
T.In addition to subsections P and S of this
section, from the maintenance and operation fund and capital outlay fund ending
cash balances, the school district governing board shall first use any
available revenues to reduce its primary tax rate to zero and shall use any
remaining revenues to fund the additional increase authorized as provided in
subsections F and M of this section.
U.If the voters in a school district disapprove the
proposed budget, the alternate budget that, except for any budget increase
authorized by a prior election, does not include an increase in the budget in
excess of the amount provided in section 15905 shall be adopted by the
governing board as provided in section 15905.
