(TEXT OF BILL BEGINS ON NEXT PAGE)





Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Arizona:
Section1.Section 38-843, Arizona Revised
Statutes, is amended to read:
START_STATUTE38-843.Contributions
A.Each employer who participates in the system on
behalf of a group of employees who were covered under a prior public retirement
system, other than the federal social security act, shall transfer all
securities and monies attributable to the taxes and contributions of the state
other than the state contribution to social security, the employer and the
employees for the covered group of employees under the other system, such
transfer to be made to the fund subject to all existing liabilities and on or
within sixty days following the employer's effective date.All
monies and securities transferred to the fund shall be credited to the
employer's account in the fund. A record of the market value and the cost
value of such transferred contributions shall be maintained for actuarial and
investment purposes.
B.As determined by actuarial valuations reported to
the employer and the local board by the board of trustees, each employer shall
make level per cent percent of compensation
contributions sufficient under such actuarial valuations to meet both the
normal cost plus the actuarially determined amount required to amortize the
unfunded accrued liability over, beginning July 1, 2005, a rolling period of at
least twenty and not more than thirty years that is established by the board of
trustees taking into account the recommendation of the system's actuary, except
that, beginning with fiscal year 20062007, except as otherwise provided,
the employer contribution rate shall not be less than eight per cent
percent of compensation.For any employer whose actual
contribution rate is less than eight per
cent percent
of compensation for fiscal year 20062007, that employer's contribution
rate is not subject to the eight per cent percent minimum but, for
fiscal year 20062007 and each year thereafter, shall be at least five per cent percent and not more than the employer's
actual contribution rate.An employer shall have the option of
paying a higher level per cent percent of compensation
thereby reducing its unfunded past service liability.An employer
shall also have the option of increasing its contributions in order to reduce
the contributions required from its members under subsection C of this section,
except that if an employer elects this option the employer shall pay the same
higher level percentage contribution for all members of the eligible group. A
county employer that elected to pay a higher level percentage contribution rate
may eliminate that higher level percentage contribution rate amount for members
who are hired on or after January 1, 2015.During a period when an
employee is on industrial leave and the employee elects to continue
contributions during the period of industrial leave, the employer shall make
the contributions based on the compensation the employee would have received in
the employee's job classification if the employee was in normal employment
status.All contributions made by the employers and all state taxes
allocated to the fund shall be irrevocable and shall be used to pay benefits
under the system or to pay expenses of the system and fund.The
minimum employer contribution that is paid and that is in excess of the normal
cost plus the actuarially determined amount required to amortize the unfunded
accrued liability as calculated pursuant to this subsection shall be used to
reduce future employer contribution increases and shall not be used to pay for
an increase in benefits that are otherwise payable to members.The
board shall separately account for these monies in the fund. Forfeitures
arising because of severance of employment before a member becomes eligible for
a pension or any other reason shall be applied to reduce the cost of the
employer, not to increase the benefits otherwise payable to members. After the
close of any fiscal year, if the system's actuary determines that the actuarial
valuation of an employer's account contains excess valuation assets other than
excess valuation assets that were in the employer's account as of fiscal year
20042005 and is more than one hundred per cent
percent funded, the board shall account for fifty per cent
percent of the excess valuation assets in a stabilization reserve
account.After the close of any fiscal year, if the system's actuary
determines that the actuarial valuation of an employer's account has a
valuation asset deficiency and an unfunded actuarial accrued liability, the
board shall use any valuation assets in the stabilization reserve account for
that employer, to the extent available, to limit the decline in that employer's
funding ratio to not more than two per
cent percent.

C.Each member, throughout the member's period of
service from the member's effective date of participation, shall contribute to
the fund an amount equal to the amount prescribed in subsection E of this
section, except as provided in subsection B of this section.During
a period when an employee is on industrial leave and the employee elects to
continue contributions during the period of industrial leave, the employee
shall make the employee's contribution based on the compensation the employee
would have received in the employee's job classification if the employee was in
normal employment status. Contributions of members shall be required as a
condition of employment and membership in the system and shall be made by
payroll deductions.Every employee shall be deemed to consent to
such deductions. Payment of an employee's compensation, less such payroll
deductions, shall constitute a full and complete discharge and satisfaction of
all claims and demands by the employee relating to remuneration for the
employee's services rendered during the period covered by the payment, except
with respect to the benefits provided under the system.A member may
not, under any circumstance, borrow from, take a loan against or remove
contributions from the member's account before the termination of membership in
the plan or the receipt of a pension.
D.Each employer shall transfer to the board the
employer and employee contributions provided for in subsections B and C of this
section within ten working days after each payroll date. Contributions
transferred after that date shall include a penalty of ten per cent
percent per annum, compounded annually, for each day the
contributions are late, such penalty to be paid by the
employer.Delinquent payments due under this subsection, together
with interest charges as provided in this subsection, may be recovered by
action in a court of competent jurisdiction against an employer liable for the
payments or, at the request of the board, may be deducted from any other
monies, including excise revenue taxes, payable to such employer by any department
or agency of this state.
E.The amount contributed by a member pursuant to
subsection C of this section is:
1.Through June 30, 2011, 7.65 per cent
percent of the member's compensation.
2.For fiscal year 20112012, 8.65 per cent percent of the member's compensation.
3.For fiscal year 20122013, 9.55 per cent percent of the member's compensation.
4.For fiscal year 20132014, 10.35 per cent percent of the member's compensation.
5.For fiscal year 20142015, 11.05 per cent percent of the member's compensation.
6.For fiscal year 20152016 and each fiscal
year thereafter, 11.65 per cent percent of the member's
compensation or 33.3 per cent percent of the sum of the
member's contribution rate from the preceding fiscal year and the aggregate
computed employer contribution rate that is calculated pursuant to subsection B
of this section, whichever is lower, except that the member contribution rate
shall not be less than 7.65 per cent percent of the member's
compensation and the employer contribution rate shall not be less than the rate
prescribed in subsection B of this section.
F.For fiscal year 20112012 and each fiscal
year thereafter, the amount of the member's contribution that exceeds 7.65 per cent percent of the member's compensation shall not
be used to reduce the employer's contributions that are calculated pursuant to
subsection B of this section.
G.A
contribution made under this section by a city, town or county in excess of the
city's, town's or county's required contribution is excluded from the city's,
town's or county's expenditure limitation established pursuant to article IX,
section 20, Constitution of Arizona. END_STATUTE
