A RESOLUTION

recognizing the historical truth of the Armenian genocide.

(TEXT OF BILL BEGINS ON NEXT PAGE)





Whereas, April 2016 marks the 101st anniversary of the
beginning of the Ottoman Empire's systematic extermination of its Armenian
population; and
Whereas, the forced deportation and massacre of more than 1.5
million Armenians, Assyrians and Greeks represented the final culmination of a
series of violent persecutions dating back to the late 1800s; and
Whereas, the worst segment of the genocide spanned from 1915 to
1920 and involved the use of murder, forced labor and deportation, the burning
of churches and schools, rape, torture and forced conversion to further the
eradication of minority populations from their homelands; and
Whereas, the actions of the Ottoman government were heavily
documented by multiple humanitarian organizations, the British government,
United States Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire Henry Morganthau and the United
States Department of State; and
Whereas, as early as May 24, 1915, the massacres documented by
these sources drew an official rebuke to the Sublime Porte from the Allied
governments, which promised to hold personally responsible "all members of
the Ottoman government and those of their agents who are implicated in such
massacres;" and
Whereas, the denial of this historical fact is an
unconscionable evil that must not be accommodated any longer; and
Whereas, the events surrounding the Armenian persecution have
been recognized as genocide by the European Parliament, the governments of 29
countries and 43 of the 50 United States.
Therefore
Be it resolved by the House of
Representatives of the State of Arizona:
That the Members of the House of Representatives recognize the
historical truth of the Armenian genocide and support the official adoption of
a similar position by the United States Department of State.
