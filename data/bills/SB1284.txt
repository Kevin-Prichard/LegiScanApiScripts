any covered person or entity is about to engage in, any act or practice
prohibited by sections 411492.01,
through 411492.02, 411492.03, 411492.04 AND 411492.05
or that any covered entity has not performed an act required by this article
and its implementing rules may institute a civil action for preventive or
mandatory relief, including an application for a permanent or temporary
injunction, restraining order or other order.
B.In the case of a violation of sections 411492.02
and 411492.04 injunctive relief includes an order to alter facilities to
make these facilities readily accessible to and usable by individuals with
disabilities to the extent required by this article.If appropriate,
injunctive relief also includes requiring the provision of an auxiliary aid or
service, the modification of a policy or the provision of alternative methods,
to the extent required by this article.
C.A person may file a civil action in superior
court not later than two years after the occurrence or the termination of an
alleged discriminatory public accommodation practice or the breach of a
conciliation agreement entered into under this article, whichever occurs last,
to obtain appropriate relief with respect to the discriminatory public
accommodation practice or breach.
D.Nothing in this section requires a person with a
disability to engage in a civil action.
E.Before
filing a civil action pursuant to this section, a person or the person's
attorney shall provide written notice to the covered person or entity that
includes sufficient detail to allow the covered person or entity to identify
the prohibited act or practice or to comply with the law. If the covered
person or entity does not cure the prohibited act or practice or comply with
the law within sixty days after receiving the notice, the person may file the
civil action.
F.When
filing a civil action pursuant to this section, a person must file an
affidavit, under penalty of perjury, that the person has read the entire complaint
and agrees with all of the allegations and facts contained in the complaint and
that the person is not receiving anything of value from an attorney in exchange
for filing the civil action.
G.A person
or the person's attorney may not demand a specific amount of money from the
covered person or entity before a civil action is commenced but may state that
the covered person or entity may be civilly liable for a violation of this
article.
H.On the
motion of any party, the court may stay an action filed pursuant to this
section to determine if the person filing the civil action or the person's
attorney is a vexatious litigant or to determine if there are multiple civil
actions that involve the same plaintiff or attorney and that should be consolidated
for trial.
I.The court
may not award civil penalties and compensatory damages in a civil action
commenced pursuant to this section. END_STATUTE
Sec.2.Section 41-1492.09, Arizona Revised
Statutes, is amended to read:

A.The attorney general shall investigate all
alleged violations of this article.These allegations must be filed
within one hundred eighty days after the occurrence or the termination of the
alleged discriminatory practice, shall be in writing under oath and shall be in
such form as the attorney general requires.The attorney general
shall undertake periodic reviews of compliance of covered entities under this
article.If the attorney general concludes at any time after the
filing of a complaint of alleged violation, or as a result of a periodic
compliance review, that prompt judicial action is necessary to carry out the purpose
of this article, the attorney general may file a civil action for appropriate
temporary or preliminary relief pending final disposition of the complaint or
compliance review.If, after investigation, the attorney general
determines that reasonable cause exists to believe this article is being
violated, the attorney general shall attempt for a period of not more than
thirty days to effectuate a conciliation agreement.If no
conciliation agreement has been reached after thirty days, the attorney general
shall file a civil action in an appropriate court.If the attorney
general determines that no reasonable cause exists to believe that a violation
of this article has occurred or is about to occur, the attorney general shall
promptly dismiss the complaint and give written notice of the dismissal to the
complainant and the person or entity complained against.If the
attorney general finds reasonable cause to believe that a party has breached a
conciliation agreement, the attorney general shall file a civil action for
enforcement of the agreement.
B.In any civil action under this article brought by the attorney general, the court:
1.May grant any equitable relief that the court
considers to be appropriate, including, to the extent required by this title:

relief.

modification of a policy, practice or procedure or an alternative method.

usable by individuals with disabilities.

considers appropriate, including monetary damages to aggrieved
persons.In this paragraph "monetary damages" and
"such other relief" do not include punitive damages.
C.In an action brought by the attorney general, the
court, to vindicate the public interest, may assess a civil penalty against the
covered person or entity in an amount of not more than:
1.Five thousand dollars for a first violation.
2.Ten thousand dollars for any subsequent
violation.
D.For the purposes
of subsection C of this section,
in determining whether a first or subsequent violation has occurred, a
determination in a single action, by judgment or settlement, that the covered
person or entity has engaged in more than one discriminatory act shall be
deemed a single violation.
E.In a civil action brought by the attorney general pursuant to this section,
when considering what amount of civil penalty, if any, is appropriate, the
court shall give consideration to any good faith effort or attempt to comply
with this article by the entity.In evaluating good faith, the court
shall consider, among other factors it deems relevant, whether the entity could
have reasonably anticipated the need for an appropriate type of auxiliary aid
needed to accommodate the unique needs of a particular individual with a
disability.
F.In any action or proceeding under this section,
the court may allow the prevailing party, other than the attorney general,
reasonable attorney fees as part of the costs.
G.If appropriate, and to the extent authorized by
law, the use of alternative means of dispute resolution, including settlement
negotiations, conciliation, facilitation, mediation, factfinding, minitrials
and arbitration, is encouraged to resolve disputes arising under this article. END_STATUTE
