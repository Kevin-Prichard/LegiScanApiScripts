urging the
Arizona Supreme Court to modify its rules related to the State Bar of Arizona
to ensure the protection of First Amendment freedoms.

(TEXT OF BILL BEGINS ON NEXT PAGE)





To the Arizona Supreme Court:
Your memorialist respectfully represents:
Whereas, integrated bar
associations "implicate the First Amendment freedom of association, which
includes the freedom to choose not to associate, and the First Amendment
freedom of speech, which also includes the freedom to remain silent or to avoid
subsidizing group speech with which a person disagrees," Kingstad v.
State Bar of Wis., 622 F.3d 708, 712-13 (7th Cir. 2010); and
Whereas, in Keller v. State Bar
of California, 496 U.S. 1 (1990), the United States Supreme Court held that
California's integrated bar interfered with the First Amendment freedoms of its
members by using their dues for political and ideological activities and that
members' dues may be used only for activities such as the regulation of the
legal profession or the improvement of legal services; and
Whereas, any time an integrated bar
exercises political influence or otherwise acts as a trade association, it puts
the First Amendment freedoms of its members at risk and creates the potential
for future litigation; and
Whereas, state bar associations
continue to violate Keller by using members' dues to engage in political
or ideological behaviors, thereby forcing its members to subsidize those
activities whether or not they agree with them; and
Whereas, the State Bar of Arizona
admittedly spends its members' dues on political speech, including lobbying and
electioneering; and
Whereas, the State Bar of Arizona
recently lobbied against a recent legislative measure to replace Arizona's
integrated bar association with a regulatory-only bar run by the Arizona
Supreme Court; and
Whereas, the State Bar of Arizona
maintains a web page supporting Arizona's merit selection system and has taken
a variety of controversial public positions regarding merit selection; and
Whereas, the State Bar of Arizona
takes other political positions with which some of its members may disagree and
uses the mandatory fees of these members to do so; and
Whereas, the Arizona Supreme Court
has asserted a claim to exclusive authority over the regulation of attorneys
and the governance of the State Bar of Arizona.
Wherefore your
memorialist, the House of Representatives of the State of Arizona, the Senate
concurring, prays:
 1.That the Arizona Supreme Court modify
its rules related to the State Bar of Arizona to ensure compliance with Keller
and the protection of the First Amendment freedoms of Arizona attorneys.
2.That the Secretary of State transmit
copies of this Memorial to each justice of the Arizona Supreme Court.
