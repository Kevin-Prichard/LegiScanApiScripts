Arizona Revised Statutes, is amended by adding section 41-882, to read:
START_STATUTE41-882.Historic preservation tax credit; definitions
A.The
Arizona state parks board shall receive applications and evaluate and certify
the substantial rehabilitation of a historic structure for the purpose of
income tax credits under sections 431075 and 431163.The
board may authorize a qualified local government agency to perform the
certification process, USING THE FORMS AND applying the standards and policies
adopted by the board or otherwise required by this section.For the
purposes of this subsection, "Qualified local government agency"
means an agency of a county, city or town that is identified and designated by
the board as having the capacity to administer preservation programs, including
the certification process required by this section.
B.The board
shall establish and adopt a schedule for receiving, evaluating and approving
applications twice each year for certification under this section. Sixty
percent of the annual aggregate tax credit dollar limit prescribed by
subsection M of this section is reserved each year for certification during the
first application period of rehabilitation projects located in cities and towns
with a population of less than one hundred fifty thousand persons. The
remainder of the annual aggregate tax credit dollar limit may be certified in
the second application period each year with respect to rehabilitation projects
located anywhere in this state.
C.The board
may issue an initial certification before the historic structure is placed in
service if the rehabilitation is consistent with the standards for
rehabilitation prescribed by the secretary of the United States department of
the interior as determined by the board.The initial certification
does not entitle a taxpayer to a credit under section 431075 or 431163.
For the purposes of this subsection, "placed in service" means that
the rehabilitation work has been substantially completed to allow the occupancy
of the structure or an identifiable part of the structure, or the owner has
begun depreciating the qualifying rehabilitation expenses, whichever occurs
first.
D.The board
may issue a final certification for a rehabilitation project that received an
initial certification if, after the completion of the rehabilitation work, the
rehabilitation:
1.Is
consistent with the standards for rehabilitation prescribed by the secretary of
the United States department of the interior as determined by the board.
2.Produces
a positive economic impact for this state or the local municipality under the
costbenefit analysis required under subsection I of this section.
3.Achieves
the minimum number of points necessary under the rehabilitation grading system
established by the board pursuant to subsection H of this section.
E.The board shall prescribe the form of
application for both the initial and final certifications of the
rehabilitation.
F.Except for the costbenefit analysis
required BY SUBSECTION I OF this section, the board may rely on facts as stated
in the application without independent investigation.The amount of
the qualifying rehabilitation expenses shall be determined by a certified
public accountant licensed in this state and filed as part of the application
for final certification.
G.If the
board becomes aware of information that is materially inconsistent with the
information provided in the application for initial or final certification, the
board may deny the request for the initial or final certification or revoke an
issued initial or final certification.
H.The board
shall adopt and use a point system for evaluating and grading proposed
rehabilitations of historic structures that are the subject of applications.
Points shall be awarded based on positive job growth, significant positive
economic impact and community support of the rehabilitation proposal.
I.The
Arizona commerce authority shall conduct a costbenefit analysis of the
rehabilitation project.The board may not issue a final
certification unless the authority determines as a result of its analysis that
the proposed rehabilitation will produce a positive economic impact for this
state or the local municipality once the certified historic structure is in
use.
J.Within
ninety days after receiving an application for final certification, the board
shall issue to the applicant a written determination either approving or
denying the rehabilitation and certifying the amount of the tax credit allowed.
K.The board
shall include in its final certification the amount of the tax credit for which
a rehabilitation qualifies and issue a numbered certificate of qualification to
the owner of the historic structure for purposes of filing for income tax
credit.
L.The board
shall charge and collect a fee of 2.25 percent of the qualifying rehabilitation
expenses for each application.The board shall use the monies for
the costs of implementing and administering the certification process
prescribed by this section. The fees received by the board under this
subsection do not revert to the state general fund.
M.The board
may certify substantial rehabilitations of historic structures for the purpose
of tax credits under sections 431075 and 431163 in an annual
aggregate credit amount of not more than fifteen million dollars for taxable
years beginning from and after December 31, 2016 through December 31, 2036,
except that for taxable years beginning from and after December 31, 2026
through December 31, 2036, and conditioned on a favorable review by the joint
legislative budget committee, the board may certify an additional annual
aggregate credit amount of not more than fifteen million dollars.
N.By applying for certification, the owner of
the historic structure grants a restrictive covenant to the board for the
holding period and agrees that, unless the board approves, alterations will not
be made to the historic structure during the holding period that are
inconsistent with the standards for rehabilitation prescribed by the secretary
of the United States department of the interior as determined by the board.
For the purposes of this subsection, "holding period" means twentyfour
months after the board issues a final certification under this section or, if
the rehabilitation is to be completed in phases, twentyfour months after
the final certification of the final phase of the rehabilitation.
O.To the extent not otherwise prohibited by law,
the board shall provide to the department of revenue information the department
requests to determine a claimant's eligibility for a tax credit claimed under
section 431075 or 431163.

grants from federal, state or local agencies or instrumentalities.
4."Substantial rehabilitation" means
that the qualifying rehabilitation expenses of the certified historic structure
during a twentyfourmonth period chosen by the taxpayer ending
with or within the taxable year exceed fifty percent of the adjusted basis in
the structure and its structural components. If the rehabilitation is to be
done in phases set forth in architectural plans and specifications that are
