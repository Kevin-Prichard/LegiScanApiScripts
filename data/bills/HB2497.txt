START_STATUTE9-506.Authority to issue license; limitations; permits for WiFi
radio equipment; definitions
A.For the purpose of authorizing and regulating the
construction, operation and maintenance of cable television systems, the
licensing authority of a city, including a charter city, or town for an
incorporated area, or the licensing authority of the county for unincorporated
areas, either individually or jointly by intergovernmental contract, may issue
a license to any person to use public streets, roads and alleys and shall
impose conditions, restrictions and limitations upon on
the use of public streets, roads and alleys and upon on
the construction, operation and maintenance of cable television
systems.
B.Subject to the limitations of this section, a
licensing authority may adopt resolutions or ordinances implementing and
controlling the license or joint license, issue a license containing other
terms and conditions and impose a license fee on gross revenues. In addition
to the limitations of this section, the license is subject to the limits
established by the communications act of 1934, as amended (47 United States
Code sections 151 through 615b) and the federal communications commission.
C.Other than the license fee on gross revenues
authorized by this article and transaction privilege taxes as provided in this
subsection, a licensing authority may not levy a tax, rent, fee or charge,
however denominated, on a cable operator for the use of the public streets,
roads or alleys to provide cable service or levy a tax, fee or charge on the
privilege of engaging in the business of providing cable service in the area of
jurisdiction.Taxes, rents, fees and charges include all access
channel support except for in-kind services or payments as provided in
subsection D of this section,
and all rental,
application, construction, permit, inspection, inconvenience and other fees and
charges related to a cable operator's use of the public streets, roads and
alleys, including the use authorized by
subsection I of this section.This subsection does not prohibit a licensing authority from
levying fees and charges for microcell equipment on a cable operator as
provided under section 9584. In addition, the following
apply:
1.Any transaction privilege taxes otherwise
authorized by law to be levied on the business of providing cable service or in
relation to use of the public streets, roads or alleys to provide cable service
may be levied on a cable operator if the taxes are levied only on gross
revenues and the rate of the taxes is subject to paragraph 3 of this
subsection.This subsection does not authorize the imposition of
transaction privilege taxes on interstate telecommunications services.
2.The license fee and any transaction privilege
taxes levied on gross revenues constitute a franchise fee within the meaning of
47 United States Code section 542(g)(1).
3.Under no circumstances may the total of the rates
of the license fee and of any transaction privilege taxes on gross revenues
levied or assessed by a licensing authority for the privilege of providing
cable service and related use of the public streets, roads or alleys to provide
cable service exceed a rate of five per
cent percent,
except during the transition period for certain licenses as provided in
subsection H of this section.
4.A cable operator shall pass on to subscribers any

the amendment to this section effective on September 21, 2006.
D.A licensing authority may not require a cable
operator to provide in-kind services, make in-kind payments or pay a fee in
addition to the monetary license fee levied or assessed as provided in this
section as part of or as a condition of issuing a license to provide cable
service, except that:
1.A licensing authority may require a cable
operator to provide channel capacity to transmit programming over which the
cable operator exercises no editorial control except as authorized by 47 United
States Code section 531(e). The channel capacity shall be limited to not more
than two channels of public, educational or governmental access programming in
the basic service tier of the cable television system and not more than two
channels of noncommercial governmental programming, at least one of which may
be programmed by the federal government, in the digital programming tier of the
cable television system.If channel capacity is required, the
programming shall be specified in the license and the cable operator may
require that the channels regularly display an unobtrusive logo or other
suitable identifier of the cable operator as set forth in the license.

operator to incur costs and expenses to provide, maintain and operate
facilities and equipment of the cable television system, including facilities

pursuant to paragraph 1 of this subsection, the costs and expenses incurred
pursuant to paragraph 2 of this subsection and the value of basic service
provided pursuant to paragraph 3 of this subsection may not be offset against
the license fee levied or assessed under this section.
E.This section does not prohibit a cable operator
from agreeing to provide in-kind services or make in-kind payments in the area
of jurisdiction that are prohibited by subsection D of this section if the
agreement with the licensing authority is not part of, or entered into as a
condition of being issued, a new, renewed or amended license to provide cable
service.An agreement that requires in-kind cable service or
payments shall set forth the total annual fair market value of the in-kind
cable service and payments, which shall be less than or equal to and offset
against the license fee levied or assessed annually pursuant to this
section.The license shall authorize the cable operator to retain

subsection C.
2.Pay fines, fees, charges or damages for breach of
the terms and conditions of the license.

2006, including one that is later renewed or extended for a term that begins
before July 1, 2007, is enforceable in accordance with its terms and conditions
as of July 1, 2007 and is not subject to the provisions of the amendment to
this section effective on September 21, 2006. If a license that is in effect
on September 21, 2006 is later extended or renewed for a term that begins after
June 30, 2007, the extended or renewed license is subject to the provisions of
the amendment to this section effective on September 21, 2006 and of the amendment to this section effective on September 19, 2007,
effective on the first day of the renewal or extension term, unless the term

of jurisdiction. The permits shall allow installation, operation and
maintenance of the permitted WiFi radio equipment. A licensing
authority may require that all of the permitted WiFi radio equipment at
a single location fit within a fifteeninch cube and be contained
entirely within a groundmounted pedestal otherwise allowed by the
license or be connected directly to and mounted at the same height as one of
the cable operator's aerial horizontal conductors otherwise allowed by the
license.This article does not authorize the imposition of a tax,
rent, fee or charge on revenue from services provided through permitted WiFi
radio equipment.
I.J.For the purposes of subsection H of this section: ,
1."Gross
effective rate" means one hundred per
cent percent multiplied
by the fraction in which the numerator is the sum of all taxes, fees and
charges of the licensing authority that the cable operator itemized to subscribers
and paid to the licensing authority under the license for the twelve calendar
months immediately preceding September 21, 2006 and the denominator is the
cable operator's gross revenues for that period in the area of jurisdiction.

Sec.3.Legislative findings
Wireless services bring important daily benefits to the
residents of this state, including sending and receiving constitutionally
protected speech and other communications. Varying access to the public
highways, streets, roads and alleys across multiple subdivisions of this state
can impede the use of these services by, and their delivery to, the residents
of this state. Therefore, the legislature finds, determines and declares that
this act is necessary as a matter of statewide concern to ensure that cities,
towns and counties, including charter cities, compatibly and effectively
authorize, administer and manage the use of the public highways, streets, roads
and alleys for the provision of certain licensed and unlicensed wireless
communication services. It is the public policy of this state that this
act be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by federal law.
Sec.4.Retroactivity; applicability
A.Section 9-506, subsection C, Arizona Revised
Statutes, as amended by this act, prohibiting a licensing authority from
levying a tax, rent, fee or charge for certain use of the public streets, roads
and alleys for permitted Wi-Fi radio equipment applies retroactively to from
and after December31, 2015. This retroactive application supersedes
any requirements and agreements to pay such tax, rent, fee or charge that was
adopted or made on or before the effective date of this act.
B.Section 9-506, subsection I, Arizona Revised
Statutes, as added by this act, allowing a licensed cable operator to attach to
the cable television system and operate and maintain permitted Wi-Fi radio
equipment in public streets, roads and alleys applies to all licenses issued
before the effective date of this act.
C.Section 9-584, Arizona Revised Statutes, as added
by this act, allowing certain persons to install, operate and maintain
microcell equipment in the public highways within a political subdivision
applies to all persons specified in this act, including those with
telecommunications or cable licenses or other authorizations that took effect
or were issued before the effective date of this act.
