(ii)For high schools, a parttime student who
is enrolled in less than four subjects that count toward graduation as defined
by the state board of education, each of which, if taught each school day for
the minimum number of days required in a school year, would meet a minimum of
one hundred twentythree hours a year, or the equivalent, in a recognized
