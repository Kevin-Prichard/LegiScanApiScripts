alteration of existing property is not subject to tax under this section if the
contract does not include modification activities, except as specified in this
subsection.The gross proceeds of sales or gross income derived from
a de minimis amount of modification activity does not subject the contract or
any part of the contract to tax under this section. For the purposes of this
subsection:
1.Tangible personal
property that is incorporated or fabricated into a project described in this
subsection may be subject to the amount prescribed in section 425008.01.
2.Each contract is
independent of any other contract, except that any change order that directly
relates to the scope of work of the original contract shall be treated the same
as the original contract under this chapter, regardless of the amount of
modification activities included in the change order. If a change order does
not directly relate to the scope of work of the original contract, the change
order shall be treated as a new contract, with the tax treatment of any

the scope of work of the subsequent change order directly relates.

Q.Notwithstanding
subsection R, paragraph 10 of this section, a person owning real property who
enters into a contract for sale of the real property, who is responsible to the
new owner of the property for modifications made to the property in the period
subsequent to the transfer of title and who receives a consideration for the
modifications is considered a prime contractor solely for purposes of taxing
the gross proceeds of sale or gross income received for the modifications made subsequent
to the transfer of title. The original owner's gross proceeds of sale or gross
income received for the modifications shall be determined according to the
following methodology:
1.If any part of the
contract for sale of the property specifies amounts to be paid to the original
owner for the modifications to be made in the period subsequent to the transfer
of title, the amounts are included in the original owner's gross proceeds of
sale or gross income under this section.Proceeds from the sale of
the property that are received after transfer of title and that are unrelated
to the modifications made subsequent to the transfer of title are not
considered gross proceeds of sale or gross income from the modifications.
2.If the original owner
enters into an agreement separate from the contract for sale of the real
property providing for amounts to be paid to the original owner for the
modifications to be made in the period subsequent to the transfer of title to
the property, the amounts are included in the original owner's gross proceeds
of sale or gross income received for the modifications made subsequent to the
transfer of title.
3.If the original owner
is responsible to the new owner for modifications made to the property in the
period subsequent to the transfer of title and derives any gross proceeds of
sale or gross income from the project subsequent to the transfer of title other
than a delayed disbursement from escrow unrelated to the modifications, it is
presumed that the amounts are received for the modifications made subsequent to
the transfer of title unless the contrary is established by the owner through
its books, records and papers kept in the regular course of business.
4.The tax base of the
original owner is computed in the same manner as a prime contractor under this
section.
R.Notwithstanding
subsection B of this section, the activities described in subsection B,
paragraphs 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 14, 15, 16 and 19 are not deductible in
