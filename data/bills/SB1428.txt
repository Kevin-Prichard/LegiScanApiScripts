Revised Statutes, is amended by adding section 38-842.01, to read:
START_STATUTE38-842.01.Benefit election; eligibility; disability; employees hired
on or after July 1, 2017
A.An employee who is hired on or after July 1,
2017 and who was not an active, an inactive or a retired member of the system
or a member of the system with a disability on June 30, 2017 is eligible to
participate in the system or the public safety personnel defined contribution
retirement plan established pursuant to article 4.1 of this chapter, depending
on the employee's election under this section. The employee's participation in
either the system or the public safety personnel defined contribution retirement
plan established pursuant to article 4.1 of this chapter begins ninety days
after the date the employee is hired. Unless the elections made under this
section are made before the ninetieth day after the date of employment, the
employee is automatically enrolled in the system for the remainder of the
employee's employment with any employer under the system. Any election made
under this section is irrevocable and is the employee's election for the
remainder of the employee's employment with any employer under the system,
regardless of whether the employee's employment is continuous.The
employee may make one of the following irrevocable elections:
1.To participate solely in the system.
2.To participate solely in the public safety
personnel defined contribution retirement plan established pursuant to article
4.1 of this chapter.
B.An employee who makes an election to
participate solely in the system or is automatically enrolled in the system
pursuant to subsection A of this section and who is not covered by the federal
old age and survivors insurance system is also enrolled in the public safety
personnel defined contribution retirement plan established pursuant to article
4.1 of this chapter during any period that the employee is not covered by the federal
old age and survivors insurance system through an employer under the system.
If such employee is subsequently covered by the federal old age and survivors
insurance system, the employee may not make any contributions to the public
safety personnel defined contribution retirement plan established pursuant to
article 4.1 of this chapter that are described in section 38867,
subsection A, paragraph 1 or subsection B during the period the employee is
covered by the federal old age and survivors insurance system. If at any later
time the employee is not covered by the federal old age and survivors insurance
system through an employer under the system, the employee shall again be
required to contribute to the public safety personnel defined contribution retirement
plan established pursuant to article 4.1 of this chapter as required by section
38867, subsection A, paragraph 1 and, if the employee made an
irrevocable election to contribute more of the employee's gross pensionable
compensation to the public safety personnel defined contribution plan as

Sec.5.Section 38-843, Arizona Revised Statutes,
is amended to read:
START_STATUTE38-843.Contributions
A.Each employer who participates in the system on
behalf of a group of employees who were covered under a prior public retirement
system, other than the federal social security act, shall transfer all
securities and monies attributable to the taxes and contributions of the state
other than the state contribution to social security, the employer and the
employees for the covered group of employees under the other system, such
transfer to be made to the fund subject to all existing liabilities and on or
within sixty days following the employer's effective date. All monies and
securities transferred to the fund shall be credited to the employer's account
in the fund. A record of the market value and the cost value of such
transferred contributions shall be maintained for actuarial and investment
purposes.
B.As determined by actuarial valuations reported to
the employer and the local board by the board of trustees, each employer shall
make level per cent of compensation
contributions sufficient under such actuarial valuations to meet both the
normal cost for members hired before
July 1, 2017 plus the actuarially determined amount required to
amortize the unfunded accrued liability on
a level percent of compensation basis for all employees of the employer who are
members of the system or participants as defined in section 38865,
paragraph 7, subdivision (a) over, beginning July 1, 2005
2017, a rolling
closed period of at least not more than twenty and not more than thirty years that is
established by the board of trustees taking into account the recommendation of
the system's actuary, except that, beginning with fiscal year 20062007,
except as otherwise provided, the employer contribution rate shall not be less
than eight per cent percent of compensation. For
any employer whose actual contribution rate is less than eight per cent
percent of compensation for fiscal year 20062007, that
employer's contribution rate is not subject to the eight per cent percent minimum but, for fiscal year 20062007 and
each year thereafter, shall be at least five per cent
percent and not more than the employer's actual contribution
rate.An employer shall have the option of paying a higher level per cent percent of compensation thereby reducing its
unfunded past service liability.An employer shall also have the
option of increasing its contributions in order to reduce the contributions
required from its members under subsection C of this section, except that if an
employer elects this option the employer shall pay the same higher level
percentage contribution for all members of the eligible group. A county
employer that elected to pay a higher level percentage contribution rate may
eliminate that higher level percentage contribution rate amount for members who
are hired on or after January 1, 2015.During a period when an
employee is on industrial leave and the employee elects to continue
contributions during the period of industrial leave, the employer shall make
the contributions based on the compensation the employee would have received in
the employee's job classification if the employee was in normal employment
status.All contributions made by the employers and all state taxes
allocated to the fund shall be irrevocable and shall be used to pay benefits
under the system or to pay expenses of the system and fund. The minimum
employer contribution that is paid and that is in excess of the normal cost
plus the actuarially determined amount required to amortize the unfunded
accrued liability as calculated pursuant to this subsection shall be used to
reduce future employer contribution increases and shall not be used to pay for
an increase in benefits that are otherwise payable to members.The
board shall separately account for these monies in the fund. Forfeitures
arising because of severance of employment before a member becomes eligible for
a pension or any other reason shall be applied to reduce the cost of the
employer, not to increase the benefits otherwise payable to members. After the
close of any fiscal year, if the system's actuary determines that the actuarial
valuation of an employer's account contains excess valuation assets other than
excess valuation assets that were in the employer's account as of fiscal year
20042005 and is more than one hundred per cent percent funded, the board shall account for fifty per cent percent of the excess valuation assets in a
stabilization reserve account. After the close of any fiscal year, if the
system's actuary determines that the actuarial valuation of an employer's
account has a valuation asset deficiency and an unfunded actuarial accrued
liability, the board shall use any valuation assets in the stabilization
reserve account for that employer, to the extent available, to limit the
decline in that employer's funding ratio to not more than two per cent
percent.
C.Each member who was hired before July 1, 2017, throughout the member's
period of service from the member's effective date of participation, shall
contribute to the fund an amount equal to the amount prescribed in subsection E
of this section, except as provided in subsection B of this section. Each member who was hired on or after July
1, 2017, throughout the member's period of service from the member's effective
date of participation, shall contribute to the fund an amount equal to the
amount prescribed in subsection G of this section.During
a period when an employee is on industrial leave and the employee elects to
continue contributions during the period of industrial leave, the employee
shall make the employee's contribution based on the compensation the employee
would have received in the employee's job classification if the employee was in
normal employment status.Contributions of members shall be required
as a condition of employment and membership in the system and shall be made by
payroll deductions.Every employee shall be deemed to consent to
such deductions. Payment of an employee's compensation, less such payroll
deductions, shall constitute a full and complete discharge and satisfaction of
all claims and demands by the employee relating to remuneration for the
employee's services rendered during the period covered by the payment, except
with respect to the benefits provided under the system.A member may
not, under any circumstance, borrow from, take a loan against or remove
contributions from the member's account before the termination of membership in
the plan or the receipt of a pension.
D.Each employer shall transfer to the board the
employer and employee contributions provided for in subsections B, and C and
G of this section within ten working days after each payroll
date. Contributions transferred after that date shall include a penalty of ten
per cent percent per annum, compounded annually, for
each day the contributions are late, such penalty to be paid by the
employer.Delinquent payments due under this subsection, together
with interest charges as provided in this subsection, may be recovered by
action in a court of competent jurisdiction against an employer liable for the
payments or, at the request of the board, may be deducted from any other
monies, including excise revenue taxes, payable to such employer by any
department or agency of this state.
E.The amount contributed by a member who was hired before July 1, 2017 pursuant
to subsection C of this section is:
1.Through June 30, 2011, 7.65 per cent percent of the member's compensation.
2.For fiscal year 20112012, 8.65 per cent percent of the member's compensation.
3.For fiscal year 20122013, 9.55 per cent percent of the member's compensation.
4.For fiscal year 20132014, 10.35 per cent percent of the member's compensation.
5.For fiscal year 20142015, 11.05 per cent percent of the member's compensation.
6.For fiscal year 20152016 and each fiscal
year thereafter, 11.65 per cent
percent of the member's
compensation or 33.3 per cent
percent of the sum of the
member's contribution rate from the preceding fiscal year and the aggregate
computed employer contribution rate that is calculated pursuant to subsection B
of this section, whichever is lower, except that the member contribution rate
shall not be less than 7.65 per cent
percent of the member's
compensation and the employer contribution rate shall not be less than the rate
prescribed in subsection B of this section.
F.For fiscal year 20112012 and each fiscal
year thereafter, the amount of the member's contribution that exceeds 7.65 per cent percent of the member's compensation shall not
be used to reduce the employer's contributions that are calculated pursuant to
subsection B of this section.
G.For
members hired on or after July 1, 2017, the employer and member contributions
are determined as follows:
1.As determined by actuarial
valuations reported to the employer and the local board by the board of
trustees, each employer shall make contributions sufficient under
such actuarial valuations to pay fifty percent of both the normal cost plus the
actuarially determined amount required to amortize the total unfunded accrued
liability for each employer attributable only to those members hired on or
after July 1, 2017. For each year that new unfunded liabilities are
attributable to the employer's own members hired on or after July 1, 2017, a
new amortization base representing the most recent annual gain or loss,
smoothed over a period not more than five years as determined by the board,
shall be created on a leveldollar basis over a closed period equal to
the average expected remaining service lives of all members but not more than
ten years, as determined by the board. 
2.The
remaining fifty percent of both the normal cost and actuarially determined
amount required to amortize the total unfunded accrued liability as determined
pursuant to paragraph 1 of this subsection shall be divided by the total number
of the employer's members who were hired on or after July 1, 2017 such that
each member contributes an equal percentage of the member's
compensation.Member contributions shall begin simultaneously with
membership in the system and shall be made by payroll deduction.
H.In
any fiscal year, an employer's contribution to the system in combination with
member contributions may not be less than the actuarially determined normal
cost for that fiscal year.The board may not suspend contributions
to the system unless both of the following apply:
1.The
retirement system actuary, based on the annual valuation, determines that
continuing to accrue excess earnings could result in disqualification of the
system's tax-exempt status under the provisions of the united states internal
revenue code.
2.The
board determines that the receipt of any additional contributions required
under this section would conflict with its fiduciary responsibility.
I.If
a member's employment is terminated with an employer by either party, the total
liability under the system associated with the member's service with the
employer remains with the employer. END_STATUTE

section, the limit under this paragraph, as adjusted by the board, may not
exceed the maximum compensation limit of section 401(a)(17) of the internal revenue code, as
adjusted by the United States secretary of the treasury.
B.If compensation under the system is determined on
a period of time that contains fewer than twelve calendar months, the
compensation limit for that period of time is equal to the dollar limit for the

time and the denominator is twelve.
C.The board
shall adjust the annual compensation limits under this section at the same time

public safety wage index in January. To determine the public safety wage
index:
1.Employers
represented in the public safety wage index shall provide the board pay scales
for the month of July for the enforcement classifications of public safety
officers annually in July.
2.The board
shall determine the weighted average of the change in the top of the pay scale
for public safety officers of the employers represented in the public safety
wage index. The average change shall be weighted by measuring each employer's
total number of members divided by the total number of members of all employers
represented in the public safety wage index.
D.The board
shall establish a public safety wage index that is composed of a group of
employers that represent geographic diversity across this state and that
represent:
1.Seven
large employers, each of which has one thousand or more total system members,
composed of one state law enforcement agency, one county law enforcement
agency, three municipal law enforcement agencies and two municipal fire
agencies.
2.Nine

small employers, each of which has two hundred or less total system members,
composed of three municipal law enforcement agencies, four municipal fire agencies
and three fire districts.
E.The
board may not Change the employers represented in the public safety wage index
more frequently than every ten years, unless required to maintain the
composition of employers as prescribed in subsection E of this section.
F.For the
purposes of this section, "public safety officers" means the

for all contributing members of the retirement system and plans it administers.
B.If a board or employer establishes a supplemental
defined contribution plan:
1.The Arizona state retirement system board may
delegate authority to implement the plan to its director appointed pursuant to
section 38715.
2.The employer may delegate authority to implement
the plan to its internal benefits administrator or designee.
3.The board of trustees may delegate authority to

of the plan.
(d)For the purposes of this article, enter into
intergovernmental agreements pursuant to title 11, chapter 7, article 3.
C.A supplemental defined contribution plan shall be
designed to be a qualified governmental plan under section 401(a) of the
internal revenue code. The legislature intends that a supplemental defined
contribution plan is a qualified plan under section 401 of the internal revenue
code, as amended, or successor provisions of law, and that a plan is exempt
from taxation under section 501 of the internal revenue code. The board or
employer may adopt any additional provisions to a plan that are necessary to
fulfill this intent.
D.Although designated as employee contributions,
all employee contributions made to a plan shall be picked up and paid by the
employer in lieu of contributions by the employee.The contributions
picked up by an employer may be made through a reduction in the employee's
compensation or an offset against future compensation increases, or a
combination of both.An employee participating in a plan does not
have the option of choosing to receive the contributed amounts directly instead
of the employer paying the amounts to the plan.It is intended that
all employee contributions that are picked up by the employer as provided in
this subsection shall be treated as employer contributions under section 414(h)
of the internal revenue code, shall be excluded from employees' gross income
for federal and state income tax purposes and are includable in the gross
income of the employees or their beneficiaries only in the taxable year in
which they are distributed. The specified effective date of the pickup
pursuant to this subsection shall not be before the date the plan receives
notification from the internal revenue service that all employee contributions
that are picked up by the employer as provided in this subsection shall be
treated as employer contributions pursuant to section 414(h) of the internal
revenue code. Until notification is received, any employee contributions made
under section 38953 are made with aftertax contributions. END_STATUTE

Sec.21.Legislative findings and intent
A.The legislature recognizes that in order to have
a sound public retirement system that benefits this state, taxpayers and
members of the retirement system, pursuant to article XXIX, Constitution of
Arizona, the public retirement system must be funded with contributions and
investment earnings based on actuarial methods and assumptions that are
consistent with generally accepted actuarial standards. The legislature finds
that the current structure of the public safety personnel retirement system
does not achieve this goal and that the current system imperils the retirement
security that the members of that system have come to expect. For these
reasons, the legislature intends to modify and amend the provisions of the
current system for both current and new members to make the system viable and
sustainable now and into the future.
B.The legislature further finds:
1.That the current structure of the public safety
personnel retirement system does not lead to the goal of attaining one hundred
percent funded status and jeopardizes the future payment of benefits to current
and future retirees of the retirement program.
2.That the current structure of the public safety
personnel retirement system, which requires a fixed employee contribution rate,
requires a contribution rate from employees that is insufficient in relation to
the cost associated with the benefits required by the plan design and therefore
places a greater financial burden on employers. By moving to a shared cost
structure, public safety employees will bear increased responsibility for the
fiscal health of the fund and, as the fund improves its funded status and
approaches fully funded or overfunded status, the employees will realize
decreased contribution costs that will be lower than currently required.
3.That the current method of funding benefit
increases to retirees of the public safety personnel retirement system is
flawed and makes it highly unlikely that this fund will achieve its actuarially
assumed earning rates during positive and negative investment environments and
creates an undesirable possibility of greater investment risk on the part of
the fund's trustees. It is fundamentally unsound to provide a benefit increase
during periods when the funded status of the retirement program is less than
seventy percent. Changing the manner of funding these benefit increases is
intended to improve the funded status of the public safety personnel retirement
system and is in the best interests of the members and beneficiaries of this
retirement program in that it will preserve future benefits for plan
participants.
4.It is necessary to change the future plan and
system structures for nonvested members to take into consideration the
increased life expectancy of members and future employees and make the reforms
necessary to preserve the funded status of the retirement program in future
years.
5.To protect the future benefits of retired, active
and future employees, it is necessary to make the changes outlined in this act
to preserve the funded status of this retirement program and return the program
to fiscal solvency.
C.It is the legislature's intent that this act does
not impair or amend any agreement between an employee and employer that
addresses participation in or contributions to alternative retirement plans or
compensation arrangements not administered through the public safety personnel
retirement system.
Sec.22.Conditional enactment
