States Congress to direct the appropriate federal agencies to secure the
borders of the united states.


(TEXT OF BILL BEGINS ON NEXT PAGE)





To the Congress of the United States of America:
Your memorialist respectfully represents:
Whereas, the United States is in
the midst of a border crisis; and
Whereas, the sheriffs serving along
the borders of the United States are in the epicenter of this crisis; and
Whereas, the porous borders of the
United States have resulted in the smuggling of contraband and illegal drugs,
the exploitation of human beings and the infiltration of subversives bent on
doing harm to this country; and
Whereas, federal law mandates
border security; and
Whereas, the quality of life
normally enjoyed by the citizens of the United States is being jeopardized by
an unsecure border, which enables transnational criminals and their accomplices
to prey on the citizens of the United States; and
Whereas, border security must be a standalone priority
for the federal government; and
Whereas, violence against public officials, law enforcement and
rival drug and human trafficking groups in Mexico continues to escalate and
cross international boundaries; and
Whereas, the reduction of the federal government's prosecution
of the criminal element places the citizens of the United States in harm's way,
leaving the burden on local governments to bear the costs associated with the
apprehension, prosecution and incarceration of this criminal element; and
Whereas, elected sheriffs have a statutory duty to protect and
secure the freedoms and liberties of United States citizens and must do so with
or without the help of their federal law enforcement partners and policymakers;
and
Whereas, working with limited budgets and staffing, sheriffs
along the southwestern border of the United States and sheriffs across the
nation struggle to find ways to enhance the quality of life and safety of those
they serve and to deter those who cross our borders to promote their criminal
activities; and
Whereas, local governments are cognizant of the need to bring relief
to United States citizens who are impacted by the lack of border security; and
Whereas, without aggressive prosecution of all of those who
breach the border and commit criminal acts, the border will continue to serve
as an open opportunity for the criminal element to exploit by entering the
United States to prey on this country and its citizens.
Wherefore, your
memorialist, the Senate of the State of Arizona, the House of Representatives
concurring, prays:
1.That the United
States Congress direct the appropriate federal agencies to do the following:
(a)Fully secure all of
the borders of the United States.
(b)Fully reimburse
sheriffs for the costs associated with the housing of illegal aliens who are
being charged with state crimes.
(c)Return to the
original guidelines as set forth in Operation Streamline for the prosecution of
persons crossing the United States border illegally.
2.That the Secretary of State of the State of
Arizona transmit copies of this Memorial to the President of the United States,
the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, the President of the
United States Senate and each Member of Congress from the State of Arizona.
