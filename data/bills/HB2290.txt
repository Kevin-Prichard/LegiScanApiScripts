(TEXT OF BILL BEGINS ON NEXT PAGE)





Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Arizona:
Section1.Section 36-2903.01, Arizona Revised
Statutes, is amended to read:
START_STATUTE36-2903.01.Additional powers and duties; report; definitions
A.The director of the Arizona health care cost
containment system administration may adopt rules that provide that the system
may withhold or forfeit payments to be made to a noncontracting provider by the
system if the noncontracting provider fails to comply with this article, the
provider agreement or rules that are adopted pursuant to this article and that
relate to the specific services rendered for which a claim for payment is made.
B.The director shall:
1.Prescribe uniform forms to be used by all
contractors. The rules shall require a written and signed application by the
applicant or an applicant's authorized representative, or, if the person is
incompetent or incapacitated, a family member or a person acting responsibly
for the applicant may obtain a signature or a reasonable facsimile and file the
application as prescribed by the administration.
2.Enter into an interagency agreement with the
department to establish a streamlined eligibility process to determine the
eligibility of all persons defined pursuant to section 362901, paragraph
6, subdivision(a). At the administration's option, the interagency
agreement may allow the administration to determine the eligibility of certain
persons, including those defined pursuant to section 362901, paragraph
6, subdivision(a).
3.Enter into an intergovernmental agreement with
the department to:
(a)Establish an expedited eligibility and
enrollment process for all persons who are hospitalized at the time of
application.
(b)Establish performance measures and incentives
for the department.
(c)Establish the process for management evaluation
reviews that the administration shall perform to evaluate the eligibility
determination functions performed by the department.
(d)Establish eligibility quality control reviews by
the administration.
(e)Require the department to adopt rules,
consistent with the rules adopted by the administration for a hearing process,
that applicants or members may use for appeals of eligibility determinations or
redeterminations.
(f)Establish the department's responsibility to
place sufficient eligibility workers at federally qualified health centers to
screen for eligibility and at hospital sites and level one trauma centers to
ensure that persons seeking hospital services are screened on a timely basis
for eligibility for the system, including a process to ensure that applications
for the system can be accepted on a twentyfour hour basis, seven days a
week.
(g)Withhold payments based on the allowable
sanctions for errors in eligibility determinations or redeterminations or
failure to meet performance measures required by the intergovernmental
agreement.
(h)Recoup from the department all federal fiscal
sanctions that result from the department's inaccurate eligibility
determinations. The director may offset all or part of a sanction if the
department submits a corrective action plan and a strategy to remedy the error.
4.By rule establish a procedure and time frames for
the intake of grievances and requests for hearings, for the continuation of
benefits and services during the appeal process and for a grievance process at
the contractor level.Notwithstanding sections 411092.02, 411092.03
and 411092.05, the administration shall develop rules to establish the
procedure and time frame for the informal resolution of grievances and
appeals.A grievance that is not related to a claim for payment of
system covered services shall be filed in writing with and received by the
administration or the prepaid capitated provider or program contractor not
later than sixty days after the date of the adverse action, decision or policy
implementation being grieved. A grievance that is related to a claim for
payment of system covered services must be filed in writing and received by the
administration or the prepaid capitated provider or program contractor within
twelve months after the date of service, within twelve months after the date
that eligibility is posted or within sixty days after the date of the denial of
a timely claim submission, whichever is later. A grievance for the denial of a
claim for reimbursement of services may contest the validity of any adverse
action, decision, policy implementation or rule that related to or resulted in
the full or partial denial of the claim. A policy implementation may be
subject to a grievance procedure, but it may not be appealed for a hearing.
The administration is not required to participate in a mandatory settlement
conference if it is not a real party in interest.In any proceeding
before the administration, including a grievance or hearing, persons may
represent themselves or be represented by a duly authorized agent who is not
charging a fee.A legal entity may be represented by an officer,
partner or employee who is specifically authorized by the legal entity to
represent it in the particular proceeding.
5.Apply for and accept federal funds available
under title XIX of the social security act (P.L. 8997; 79 Stat. 344; 42
United States Code section 1396 (1980)) in support of the
system.The application made by the director pursuant to this
paragraph shall be designed to qualify for federal funding primarily on a
prepaid capitated basis. Such funds may be used only for the support of
persons defined as eligible pursuant to title XIX of the social security act or
the approved section 1115 waiver.
6.At least thirty days before the implementation of
a policy or a change to an existing policy relating to reimbursement, provide
notice to interested parties. Parties interested in receiving notification of
policy changes shall submit a written request for notification to the
administration.
7.In addition to the cost sharing requirements
specified in subsection D, paragraph 4 of this section:
(a)Charge monthly premiums up to the maximum amount
allowed by federal law to all populations of eligible persons who may be
charged.
(b)Implement this paragraph to the extent permitted
under the federal deficit reduction act of 2005 and other federal laws, subject
to the approval of federal waiver authority and to the extent that any changes
in the cost sharing requirements under this paragraph would permit this state
to receive any enhanced federal matching rate.
C.The director is authorized to apply for any
federal funds available for the support of programs to investigate and
prosecute violations arising from the administration and operation of the
system.Available state funds appropriated for the administration
and operation of the system may be used as matching funds to secure federal funds
pursuant to this subsection.
D.The director may adopt rules or procedures to do
the following:
1.Authorize advance payments based on estimated
liability to a contractor or a noncontracting provider after the contractor or
noncontracting provider has submitted a claim for services and before the claim
is ultimately resolved.The rules shall specify that any advance
payment shall be conditioned on the execution before payment of a contract with
the contractor or noncontracting provider that requires the administration to
retain a specified percentage, which shall be at least twenty percent, of the
claimed amount as security and that requires repayment to the administration if
the administration makes any overpayment.
2.Defer liability, in whole or in part, of contractors
for care provided to members who are hospitalized on the date of enrollment or
under other circumstances.Payment shall be on a capped feeforservice
basis for services other than hospital services and at the rate established
pursuant to subsection G of this section for hospital services or at the rate
paid by the health plan, whichever is less.
3.Deputize, in writing, any qualified officer or
employee in the administration to perform any act that the director by law is
empowered to do or charged with the responsibility of doing, including the
authority to issue final administrative decisions pursuant to section 411092.08.
4.Notwithstanding any other law, require persons
eligible pursuant to section 362901, paragraph 6, subdivision (a), section
362931 and section 362981, paragraph 6 to be financially
responsible for any cost sharing requirements established in a state plan or a
section 1115 waiver and approved by the centers for medicare and medicaid
services. Cost sharing requirements may include copayments, coinsurance,
deductibles, enrollment fees and monthly premiums for enrolled members,
including households with children enrolled in the Arizona longterm care
system.
E.The director shall adopt rules that further
specify the medical care and hospital services that are covered by the system
pursuant to section 362907.
F.In addition to the rules otherwise specified in
this article, the director may adopt necessary rules pursuant to title 41,
chapter 6 to carry out this article. Rules adopted by the director pursuant to
this subsection shall consider the differences between rural and urban
conditions on the delivery of hospitalization and medical care.
G.For inpatient hospital admissions and outpatient
hospital services on and after March 1, 1993, the administration shall adopt
rules for the reimbursement of hospitals according to the following procedures:
1.For
inpatient hospital stays from March 1, 1993 through September30, 2014,
the administration shall use a prospective tiered per diem methodology, using
hospital peer groups if analysis shows that cost differences can be attributed
to independently definable features that hospitals within a peer group
share.In peer grouping the administration may consider such factors
as length of stay differences and labor market variations.If there
are no cost differences, the administration shall implement a stop lossstop
gain or similar mechanism. Any stop lossstop gain or similar mechanism
shall ensure that the tiered per diem rates assigned to a hospital do not
represent less than ninety percent of its 1990 base year costs or more than one
hundred ten percent of its 1990 base year costs, adjusted by an audit factor,
during the period of March 1, 1993 through September 30, 1994.The
tiered per diem rates set for hospitals shall represent no less than eightyseven
and onehalf percent or more than one hundred twelve and onehalf
percent of its 1990 base year costs, adjusted by an audit factor, from October
1, 1994 through September 30, 1995 and no less than eightyfive percent
or more than one hundred fifteen percent of its 1990 base year costs, adjusted
by an audit factor, from October 1, 1995 through September 30, 1996. For the
periods after September 30, 1996 no stop lossstop gain or similar
mechanisms shall be in effect.An adjustment in the stop lossstop
gain percentage may be made to ensure that total payments do not increase as a
result of this provision.If peer groups are used, the
administration shall establish initial peer group designations for each
hospital before implementation of the per diem system.The
administration may also use a negotiated rate methodology.The
tiered per diem methodology may include separate consideration for specialty
hospitals that limit their provision of services to specific patient
populations, such as rehabilitative patients or children.The
initial per diem rates shall be based on hospital claims and encounter data for
dates of service November 1, 1990 through October 31, 1991 and processed
through May of 1992.The administration may also establish a
separate reimbursement methodology for claims with extraordinarily high costs
per day that exceed thresholds established by the administration.
2.For rates effective on October 1, 1994, and
annually through September 30, 2011, the administration shall adjust tiered per
diem payments for inpatient hospital care by the data resources incorporated
market basket index for prospective payment system hospitals.For
rates effective beginning on October 1, 1999, the administration shall adjust
payments to reflect changes in length of stay for the maternity and nursery
tiers.
3.Through June 30, 2004, for outpatient hospital
services, the administration shall reimburse a hospital by applying a hospital
specific outpatient costtocharge ratio to the covered charges.
Beginning on July 1, 2004 through June 30, 2005, the administration shall
reimburse a hospital by applying a hospital specific outpatient costtocharge
ratio to covered charges. If the hospital increases its charges for outpatient
services filed with the Arizona department of health services pursuant to
chapter 4, article 3 of this title, by more than 4.7 percent for dates of
service effective on or after July 1, 2004, the hospital specific costtocharge
ratio will be reduced by the amount that it exceeds 4.7 percent. If charges
exceed 4.7 percent, the effective date of the increased charges will be the
effective date of the adjusted Arizona health care cost containment system costtocharge
ratio. The administration shall develop the methodology for a capped feeforservice
schedule and a statewide costtocharge ratio.Any
covered outpatient service not included in the capped feeforservice
schedule shall be reimbursed by applying the statewide costtocharge
ratio that is based on the services not included in the capped feeforservice
schedule.Beginning on July 1, 2005, the administration shall
reimburse clean claims with dates of service on or after July 1, 2005, based on
the capped feeforservice schedule or the statewide costtocharge
ratio established pursuant to this paragraph.The administration may
make additional adjustments to the outpatient hospital rates established
pursuant to this section based on other factors, including the number of beds
in the hospital, specialty services available to patients and the geographic
location of the hospital.
4.Except if submitted under an electronic claims
submission system, a hospital bill is considered received for purposes of this
paragraph on initial receipt of the legible, errorfree claim form by the
administration if the claim includes the following errorfree
documentation in legible form:
(a)An admission face sheet.
(b)An itemized statement.
(c)An admission history and physical.
(d)A discharge summary or an interim summary if the
claim is split.
(e)An emergency record, if admission was through
the emergency room.
(f)Operative reports, if applicable.
(g)A labor and delivery room report, if applicable.
Payment received by a hospital from the
administration pursuant to this subsection or from a contractor either by
contract or pursuant to section 362904, subsection I is considered
payment by the administration or the contractor of the administration's or contractor's
liability for the hospital bill.A hospital may collect any unpaid
portion of its bill from other thirdparty payors or in situations
covered by title 33, chapter 7, article3.
5.For services rendered on and after October 1,
1997, the administration shall pay a hospital's rate established according to
this section subject to the following:
(a)If the hospital's bill is paid within thirty
days of the date the bill was received, the administration shall pay ninetynine
percent of the rate.
(b)If the hospital's bill is paid after thirty days
but within sixty days of the date the bill was received, the administration
shall pay one hundred percent of the rate.
(c)If the hospital's bill is paid any time after
sixty days of the date the bill was received, the administration shall pay one
hundred percent of the rate plus a fee of one percent per month for each month
or portion of a month following the sixtieth day of receipt of the bill until
the date of payment.
6.In developing the reimbursement methodology, if a
review of the reports filed by a hospital pursuant to section 36125.04
indicates that further investigation is considered necessary to verify the
accuracy of the information in the reports, the administration may examine the
hospital's records and accounts related to the reporting requirements of
section 36125.04.The administration shall bear the cost
incurred in connection with this examination unless the administration finds
that the records examined are significantly deficient or incorrect, in which
case the administration may charge the cost of the investigation to the
hospital examined.
7.Except for privileged medical information, the
administration shall make available for public inspection the cost and charge
data and the calculations used by the administration to determine payments
under the tiered per diem system, provided that individual hospitals are not
identified by name.The administration shall make the data and
calculations available for public inspection during regular business hours and
shall provide copies of the data and calculations to individuals requesting
such copies within thirty days of receipt of a written request.The
administration may charge a reasonable fee for the provision of the data or information.
8.The prospective tiered per diem payment
methodology for inpatient hospital services shall include a mechanism for the
prospective payment of inpatient hospital capital related costs.The
capital payment shall include hospital specific and statewide average
amounts.For tiered per diem rates beginning on October 1, 1999, the
capital related cost component is frozen at the blended rate of forty percent
of the hospital specific capital cost and sixty percent of the statewide
average capital cost in effect as of January1, 1999 and as further
adjusted by the calculation of tier rates for maternity and nursery as
prescribed by law. Through September 30, 2011, the administration shall adjust
the capital related cost component by the data resources incorporated market
basket index for prospective payment system hospitals.
9.For graduate medical education programs:
(a)Beginning September 30, 1997, the administration
shall establish a separate graduate medical education program to reimburse
hospitals that had graduate medical education programs that were approved by
the administration as of October 1, 1999.The administration shall
separately account for monies for the graduate medical education program based
on the total reimbursement for graduate medical education reimbursed to
hospitals by the system in federal fiscal year 19951996 pursuant to the
tiered per diem methodology specified in this section.The graduate
medical education program reimbursement shall be adjusted annually by the
increase or decrease in the index published by the global insight hospital
market basket index for prospective hospital reimbursement. Subject to
legislative appropriation, on an annual basis, each qualified hospital shall
receive a single payment from the graduate medical education program that is
equal to the same percentage of graduate medical education reimbursement that
was paid by the system in federal fiscal year 19951996.Any
reimbursement for graduate medical education made by the administration shall
not be subject to future settlements or appeals by the hospitals to the
administration.The monies available under this subdivision shall
not exceed the fiscal year 20052006 appropriation adjusted annually by
the increase or decrease in the index published by the global insight hospital
market basket index for prospective hospital reimbursement, except for monies
distributed for expansions pursuant to subdivision (b) of this paragraph.
(b)The monies available for graduate medical
education programs pursuant to this subdivision shall not exceed the fiscal
year 20062007 appropriation adjusted annually by the increase or
decrease in the index published by the global insight hospital market basket
index for prospective hospital reimbursement.Graduate medical education
programs eligible for such reimbursement are not precluded from receiving
reimbursement for funding under subdivision (c) of this
paragraph.Beginning July 1, 2006, the administration shall
distribute any monies appropriated for graduate medical education above the
amount prescribed in subdivision (a) of this paragraph in the following order
or priority:
(i)For the direct costs to support the expansion of
graduate medical education programs established before July 1, 2006 at
hospitals that do not receive payments pursuant to subdivision (a) of this
paragraph.These programs must be approved by the administration.
(ii)For the direct costs to support the expansion
of graduate medical education programs established on or before October 1,
1999. These programs must be approved by the administration.
(c)The administration shall distribute to hospitals
any monies appropriated for graduate medical education above the amount
prescribed in subdivisions (a) and (b) of this paragraph for the following purposes:
(i)For the direct costs of graduate medical
education programs established or expanded on or after July 1, 2006. These
programs must be approved by the administration.
(ii)For a portion of additional indirect graduate
medical education costs for programs that are located in a county with a
population of less than five hundred thousand persons at the time the residency
position was created or for a residency position that includes a rotation in a
county with a population of less than five hundred thousand persons at the time
the residency position was established.These programs must be
approved by the administration.
(d)The administration shall develop, by rule, the
formula by which the monies are distributed.
(e)Each graduate medical education program that
receives funding pursuant to subdivision (b) or (c) of this paragraph shall
identify and report to the administration the number of new residency positions
created by the funding provided in this paragraph, including positions in rural
areas. The program shall also report information related to the number of
funded residency positions that resulted in physicians locating their practices
in this state. The administration shall report to the joint legislative budget
committee by February 1 of each year on the number of new residency positions
as reported by the graduate medical education programs.
(f)Local, county and tribal governments and any
university under the jurisdiction of the Arizona board of regents may provide
monies in addition to any state general fund monies appropriated for graduate
medical education in order to qualify for additional matching federal monies
for providers, programs or positions in a specific locality and costs incurred
pursuant to a specific contract between the administration and providers or
other entities to provide graduate medical education services as an
administrative activity. Payments by the administration pursuant to this
subdivision may be limited to those providers designated by the funding entity and
may be based on any methodology deemed appropriate by the administration,
including replacing any payments that might otherwise have been paid pursuant
to subdivision (a), (b) or (c) of this paragraph had sufficient state general
fund monies or other monies been appropriated to fully fund those
payments.These programs, positions, payment methodologies and
administrative graduate medical education services must be approved by the
administration and the centers for medicare and medicaid services.The
administration shall report to the president of the senate, the speaker of the
house of representatives and the director of the joint legislative budget
committee on or before July 1 of each year on the amount of money contributed
and number of residency positions funded by local, county and tribal
governments, including the amount of federal matching monies used.
(g)Any funds appropriated but not allocated by the
administration for subdivision (b) or (c) of this paragraph may be reallocated
if funding for either subdivision is insufficient to cover appropriate graduate
medical education costs.
10.Notwithstanding section 411005,
subsection A, paragraph 9, the administration shall adopt rules pursuant to
title 41, chapter 6 establishing the methodology for determining the
prospective tiered per diem payments that are in effect through September 30,
2014.
11.For inpatient hospital services rendered on or
after October 1, 2011, the prospective tiered per diem payment rates are
permanently reset to the amounts payable for those services as of October 1,
2011 pursuant to this subsection.
12.The administration shall
adopt a diagnosis-related group based hospital reimbursement methodology
consistent with title XIX of the social security act for inpatient dates of
service on and after October 1, 2014. The administration may make additional
adjustments to the inpatient hospital rates established pursuant to this
section for hospitals that are publicly operated or based on other factors,
including the number of beds in the hospital, the specialty services available
to patients, the geographic location and diagnosis-related group codes that are
made publicly available by the hospital pursuant to section 36437.The
administration may also provide additional reimbursement for extraordinarily
high cost cases that exceed a threshold above the standard
payment.The administration may also establish a separate payment
methodology for specific services or hospitals serving unique populations.
H.The director may adopt rules that specify
enrollment procedures, including notice to contractors of
enrollment.The rules may provide for varying time limits for
enrollment in different situations.The administration shall specify
in contract when a person who has been determined eligible will be enrolled
with that contractor and the date on which the contractor will be financially
responsible for health and medical services to the person.
I.The administration may make direct payments to
hospitals for hospitalization and medical care provided to a member in
accordance with this article and rules. The director may adopt rules to
establish the procedures by which the administration shall pay hospitals
pursuant to this subsection if a contractor fails to make timely payment to a
hospital.Such payment shall be at a level determined pursuant to
section 362904, subsection H orI. The director may withhold
payment due to a contractor in the amount of any payment made directly to a
hospital by the administration on behalf of a contractor pursuant to this
subsection.
J.The director shall establish a special unit
within the administration for the purpose of monitoring the thirdparty
payment collections required by contractors and noncontracting providers
pursuant to section 362903, subsection B, paragraph 10 and subsection F
and section 362915, subsection E. The director shall determine by rule:
1.The type of thirdparty payments to be
monitored pursuant to this subsection.
2.The percentage of thirdparty payments that
is collected by a contractor or noncontracting provider and that the contractor
or noncontracting provider may keep and the percentage of such payments that
the contractor or noncontracting provider may be required to pay to the
administration.Contractors and noncontracting providers must pay to
the administration one hundred percent of all thirdparty payments that
are collected and that duplicate administration feeforservice
payments.A contractor that contracts with the administration
pursuant to section 362904, subsection A may be entitled to retain a
percentage of thirdparty payments if the payments collected and retained
by a contractor are reflected in reduced capitation rates.A
contractor may be required to pay the administration a percentage of thirdparty
payments that are collected by a contractor and that are not reflected in
reduced capitation rates.
K.The administration shall establish procedures to
apply to the following if a provider that has a contract with a contractor or
noncontracting provider seeks to collect from an individual or financially
responsible relative or representative a claim that exceeds the amount that is
reimbursed or should be reimbursed by the system:
1.On written notice from the administration or oral
or written notice from a member that a claim for covered services may be in
violation of this section, the provider that has a contract with a contractor
or noncontracting provider shall investigate the inquiry and verify whether the
person was eligible for services at the time that covered services were
provided.If the claim was paid or should have been paid by the
system, the provider that has a contract with a contractor or noncontracting
provider shall not continue billing the member.
2.If the claim was paid or should have been paid by
the system and the disputed claim has been referred for collection to a
collection agency or referred to a credit reporting bureau, the provider that
has a contract with a contractor or noncontracting provider shall:
(a)Notify the collection agency and request that
all attempts to collect this specific charge be terminated immediately.
(b)Advise all credit reporting bureaus that the
reported delinquency was in error and request that the affected credit report
be corrected to remove any notation about this specific delinquency.
(c)Notify the administration and the member that
the request for payment was in error and that the collection agency and credit
reporting bureaus have been notified.
3.If the administration determines that a provider
that has a contract with a contractor or noncontracting provider has billed a
member for charges that were paid or should have been paid by the
administration, the administration shall send written notification by certified
mail or other service with proof of delivery to the provider that has a
contract with a contractor or noncontracting provider stating that this billing
is in violation of federal and state law.If, twentyone days
or more after receiving the notification, a provider that has a contract with a
contractor or noncontracting provider knowingly continues billing a member for
charges that were paid or should have been paid by the system, the
administration may assess a civil penalty in an amount equal to three times the
amount of the billing and reduce payment to the provider that has a contract
with a contractor or noncontracting provider accordingly.Receipt of
delivery signed by the addressee or the addressee's employee is prima facie
evidence of knowledge. Civil penalties collected pursuant to this subsection
shall be deposited in the state general fund.Section 362918,
subsections C, D and F, relating to the imposition, collection and enforcement
of civil penalties, apply to civil penalties imposed pursuant to this paragraph.
L.The administration may conduct postpayment review
of all claims paid by the administration and may recoup any monies erroneously
paid.The director may adopt rules that specify procedures for
conducting postpayment review. A contractor may conduct a postpayment review
of all claims paid by the contractor and may recoup monies that are erroneously
paid.
M.Subject to title 41, chapter 4, article 4, the
director or the director's designee may employ and supervise personnel
necessary to assist the director in performing the functions of the
administration.
N.The administration may contract with contractors
for obstetrical care who are eligible to provide services under title XIX of
the social security act.
O.Notwithstanding
any other law, on federal approval Pursuant to 42 United States Code section 1396r4 and the special terms and conditions
of the system's section 1115 waiver, the administration may shall make disproportionate share payments to
private qualifying hospitals, county operated hospitals, including hospitals
owned or leased by a special health care district organized pursuant to title 48, chapter 31,
and state operated institutions for
mental disease beginning October 1, 1991 in accordance with federal law and
subject to legislative appropriation the Arizona state hospital. The payments made under this subsection are subject to all
of the following:
1.Payments
made to qualifying hospitals other than hospitals owned or leased by a special
health care district organized pursuant to title 48, chapter 31 are subject to
legislative appropriation.
2.Payments
made to the Arizona state hospital are subject to legislative appropriation.
3.Payments
made to qualifying hospitals owned or leased by a special health care district
organized pursuant to title 48, chapter 31 are calculated and made pursuant to
section 362903.12.
4.If
at any time the administration receives written notification from federal
authorities of any change or difference in the actual or estimated amount of
federal funds available for disproportionate share payments from the amount
reflected in the legislative appropriation for such purposes or the payments made pursuant to section 362903.12,
the administration shall provide written notification of such that
change or difference to the president and the minority leader of
the senate, the speaker and the minority leader of the house of
representatives, the director of the joint legislative budget committee, the
legislative committee of reference and any hospital trade association within in this state, within three working days, not including weekends, after receipt of the notice
of the change or difference.
5.In
calculating disproportionate share payments as prescribed in this section subsection, the administration may use either
a methodology based on claims and encounter data that is submitted to the
administration from contractors or a methodology based on data that is reported
to the administration by private qualifying hospitals and state operated institutions for mental disease the Arizona state hospital.The
selected methodology applies to all private qualifying hospitals and state operated institutions for mental
disease qualifying
for disproportionate share payments and
the Arizona state hospital. 
P.Disproportionate share payments made pursuant to
subsection O of this section include amounts for disproportionate share
