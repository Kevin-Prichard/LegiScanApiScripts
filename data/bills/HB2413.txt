START_STATUTE41-1463.Discrimination; unlawful practices; definition
A.Nothing contained in
this article shall be interpreted to require that the less qualified be
preferred over the better qualified simply because of race, color, religion, sex
gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, age or
national origin or on the basis of disability.
B.It is an unlawful
employment practice for an employer:
1.To fail or refuse to
hire or to discharge any individual or otherwise to discriminate against any
individual with respect to the individual's compensation, terms, conditions or
privileges of employment because of the individual's race, color, religion, sex
gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, age or
national origin or on the basis of disability.
2.To limit, segregate
or classify employees or applicants for employment in any way which that
would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment
opportunities or otherwise adversely affect the individual's status as an
employee, because of the individual's race, color, religion, sex
gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, age or
national origin or on the basis of disability.
3.To fail or refuse to
hire, to discharge, or to otherwise
discriminate against any individual based on the results of a genetic test
received by the employer, notwithstanding subsection I, paragraph 2 of this
section.
C.It is an unlawful
employment practice for an employment agency to fail or refuse to refer for
employment or otherwise to discriminate against any individual because of the
individual's race, color, religion, sex gender, gender identity or
expression, sexual orientation, age or national origin or on the basis
of disability or to classify or refer for employment any individual on the
basis of the individual's race, color, religion, sex gender, gender identity or
expression, sexual orientation, age or national origin or on the basis
of disability.
D.It
is an unlawful employment practice for a labor organization:
1.To
exclude or to expel from its membership or otherwise to discriminate against
any individual because of the individual's race, color, religion, sex
gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, age or
national origin or on the basis of disability.
2.To limit, segregate
or classify its membership or applicants for membership or to classify or fail
or refuse to refer for employment any individual in any way which that
would deprive or tend to deprive the individual of employment
opportunities or would limit those employment opportunities or otherwise
adversely affect the individual's status as an employee or as an applicant for
employment because of the individual's race, color, religion, sex
gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, age or
national origin or on the basis of disability.
3.To cause or attempt
to cause an employer to discriminate against an individual in violation of this
section.
E.It is an unlawful employment
practice for any employer, labor organization or joint labormanagement
committee controlling apprenticeship or other training or retraining programs,
including onthejob training programs, to discriminate against any
individual because of the individual's race, color, religion, sex
gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, age or
national origin or on the basis of disability in admission to or employment in
any program established to provide apprenticeship or other training and, if the
individual is an otherwise qualified individual, to fail or refuse to
reasonably accommodate the individual's disability.
F.With respect to a
qualified individual, it is an unlawful employment practice for a covered
entity to:
1.Participate in any
contractual or other arrangement or relationship that has the effect of
subjecting a qualified individual who applies with or who is employed by the
covered entity to unlawful employment discrimination on the basis of
disability.
2.Use standards, criteria
or methods of administration that have the effect of discriminating on the
basis of disability or that perpetuate the discrimination of others who are
subject to common administrative control.
3.Exclude or otherwise
deny equal jobs or benefits to an individual qualified for the job or benefits
because of the known disability of an individual with whom the individual
qualified for the job or benefits is known to have a relationship or
association.
4.Not make reasonable
accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise
qualified individual who is an applicant or employee unless the covered entity
can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the
operation of the business of the covered entity or the individual only meets
the definition of disability as prescribed in section 411461, paragraph
4, subdivision (c).
5.Deny employment
opportunities to a job applicant or employee who is an otherwise qualified
individual if the denial is based on the need of the covered entity to make
reasonable accommodation to the physical or mental impairment of the applicant
or employee.
6.Use qualification
standards, employment tests or other selection criteria, including those based
on an individual's uncorrected vision, that screen out or tend to screen out an
individual with a disability or a class of individuals with disabilities,
unless the standard, test or other selection criteria, as used by the covered
entity, is shown to be job related for the position in question and is
consistent with business necessity.
7.Fail to select and
administer tests relating to employment in the most effective manner to ensure
that, when the test is administered to a job applicant or employee who has a
disability that impairs sensory, manual or speaking skills, the test results
accurately reflect the skills or aptitude or whatever other factor of the
applicant or employee that the test purports to measure, rather than reflecting
the impaired sensory, manual or speaking skills of the applicant or employee,
except if the skills are the factors that the test purports to measure.
G.Notwithstanding any
other provision of this article, it is not an unlawful employment practice:
1.For an employer to
hire and employ employees, for an employment agency to classify or refer for
employment any individual, for a labor organization to classify its membership
or classify or refer for employment any individual,
or for an employer, labor organization or joint labormanagement
committee controlling apprenticeship or other training or retraining programs
to admit or employ any individual in any such program, on the basis of the
individual's religion, sex gender or national origin in
those certain instances when religion, sex
gender or national origin
is a bona fide occupational qualification reasonably necessary to the normal
operation of that particular business or enterprise.
2.For any school,
college, university or other educational institution or institution of learning
to hire and employ employees of a particular religion if the school, college,
university or other educational institution or institution of learning is in
whole or in substantial part owned, supported, controlled or managed by a
particular religion or religious corporation, association or society, or if the
curriculum of the school, college, university or other educational institution
or institution of learning is directed toward the propagation of a particular
religion.
3.For an employer to
fail or refuse to hire or employ any individual for any position, for an
employment agency to fail or refuse to refer any individual for employment in
any position or for a labor organization to fail or refuse to refer any
individual for employment in any position, if both of the following apply:
(a)The occupancy of the
position or access to the premises in or upon which any part of the duties of
the position are performed or are to be performed is subject to any requirement
imposed in the interest of the national security of the United States under any
security program in effect pursuant to or administered under any statute of the
United States or any executive order of the president of the United States.
(b)The individual has
not fulfilled or has ceased to fulfill that requirement.
4.With respect to age,
for an employer, employment agency or labor organization:
(a)To take any action
otherwise prohibited under subsection B, C or D of this section if age is a
bona fide occupational qualification reasonably necessary to the normal operation
of the particular business or if the differentiation is based on reasonable
factors other than age.
(b)To observe the terms
of a bona fide seniority system or any bona fide employee benefit plan such as
a retirement, pension, deferred compensation or insurance plan, which is not a
subterfuge to evade the purposes of the age discrimination provisions of this
article, except that no employee benefit plan may excuse the failure to hire
any individual and no seniority system or employee benefit plan may require or
permit the involuntary retirement of any individual specified by section 411465
because of the individual's age.
(c)To discharge or
otherwise discipline an individual for good cause.
5.For a religious organization, including an
educational institution substantially controlled or supported by a religious
organization, to fail to hire, refuse to hire, refuse to promote or terminate
an employee on the basis of that employee's gender, gender identity or
expression or sexual orientation, if the position is directly related to the
religious functions of the organization or directly involved in the provision
of education to students of an educational institution substantially controlled
or supported by a religious organization.
H.As used in this
article, unlawful employment practice does not include any action or measure
taken by an employer, labor organization, joint labormanagement
committee or employment agency with respect to an individual who is a member of
the communist party of the United States or of any other organization required
to register as a communistaction or communistfront organization
by final order of the subversive activities control board pursuant to the
subversive activities control act of 1950.
I.Notwithstanding any
other provision of this article, it is not an unlawful employment practice:
1.For an employer to
apply different standards of compensation or different terms, conditions or
privileges of employment pursuant to a bona fide seniority or merit system or a
system which that measures earnings by quantity or quality
of production or to employees who work in different locations, provided that
these differences are not the result of an intention to discriminate because of
race, color, religion, sex gender, gender identity or
expression, sexual orientation or national origin.
2.For an employer to
give and act upon on the results of any
professionally developed ability test provided that the test, its
administration or action upon the results is not designed, intended or used to
discriminate because of race, color, religion, sex
gender, gender identity or
expression, sexual orientation or national origin.
3.For any employer to
differentiate upon on the basis of sex gender,
gender identity or expression, sexual orientation or disability in
determining the amount of the wages or compensation paid or to be paid to
employees of the employer if the differentiation is authorized by the
provisions of section 6(d) or section 14 of the fair labor standards act of
1938, as amended (29 United States Code section 206(d)).
J.Nothing contained in
this chapter applies to any business or enterprise on or near an Indian
reservation with respect to any publicly announced employment practice of the
business or enterprise under which a preferential treatment is given to any
individual because the individual is an Indian living on or near a reservation.
K.Nothing contained in
this article or article 6 of this chapter requires any employer, employment
agency, labor organization or joint labormanagement committee subject to
this article to grant preferential treatment to any individual or group because
of the race, color, religion, sex gender, gender identity or
expression, sexual orientation or national origin of the individual or
group on account of an imbalance which that may exist with respect
to the total number or percentage of persons of any race, color, religion, sex gender,
gender identity or expression, sexual orientation or national origin
employed by any employer, referred or classified for employment by any
employment agency or labor organization, admitted to membership or classified
by any labor organization or admitted to or employed in any apprenticeship or
other training program, in comparison with the total number or percentage of
persons of that race, color, religion, sex
gender, gender identity or
expression, sexual orientation or national origin in any community,
state, section or other area, or in the available work
force workforce in
any community, state, section or other area. This article and
article 6 of this chapter do not require any employer, employment agency, labor
organization or joint labormanagement committee subject to this article
to retain or maintain records regarding an individual's or group's gender,
gender identity or expression or sexual orientation.
L.Nothing in the age
discrimination prohibitions of this article may be construed to prohibit
compulsory retirement of any employee who has attained sixtyfive years
of age and who, for the twoyear
period immediately before retirement, is employed in a bona fide executive or
high policymaking position, if the employee is entitled to an immediate
nonforfeitable annual retirement benefit from a pension, profit sharing,
savings or deferred compensation plan or any combination of plans of the
employer for the employee, which that
equals, in the aggregate, at least fortyfour thousand dollars. In
applying the retirement benefit test of this subsection, if any retirement
benefit is in a form other than a straight life annuity, with no ancillary
benefits, or if employees contribute to the plan or make rollover
contributions, the benefit shall be adjusted in accordance with rules adopted
by the division so the benefit is the equivalent of a straight life annuity,
with no ancillary benefits, under a plan to which employees do not contribute
and under which no rollover contributions are made.
M.A covered entity may
require that an individual with a disability shall not pose a direct threat to
the health or safety of other individuals in the workplace. For the purposes
of this subsection, "direct threat" means a significant risk to the
health or safety of others that cannot be eliminated by reasonable
accommodation.
N.This article does not
alter the standards for determining eligibility for benefits under this state's
workers' compensation laws or under state and federal disability benefit
programs.
O.For the purposes of
this section and section 411481, with respect to employers or employment
practices involving a disability, "individual" means a qualified
individual. END_STATUTE
