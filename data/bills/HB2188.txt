insurance group of which the insurer is a member has annual direct written and
unaffiliated assumed premium including international direct and assumed
premium, but excluding premium reinsured with the federal crop insurance
corporation and federal flood program, less than one billion dollars.
B.If
an insurer qualifies for exemption pursuant to subsection A, paragraph 1 of

qualify for exemption pursuant to subsection A, paragraph 2 of this section,
the ORSA summary report that may be required pursuant to section 20491.03
shall include every insurer within the insurance group. This requirement is
satisfied by the submission of more than one ORSA summary report for any
combination of insurers, provided any combination of reports includes every
insurer within the insurance group.

an insurer does not qualify for exemption pursuant to subsection A, paragraph 1
of this section but the insurance group of which the insurer is a member does
qualify for exemption pursuant to subsection A, paragraph 2 of this section,
the only ORSA summary report that may be required pursuant to section 20491.03
is the report applicable to that insurer.
D.If
an insurer does not qualify for exemption pursuant to subsection A, paragraph 1
of this section, the insurer may apply to the director for a waiver from the
requirements of this article based on unique circumstances. In deciding whether
to grant the insurer's request for waiver, the director may consider the type
and volume of business written, ownership and organizational structure and any
other factor the director considers relevant to the insurer or insurance group
of which the insurer is a member. If the insurer is part of an insurance group
with insurers domiciled in more than one state, the director shall coordinate
with the lead state director or commissioner of insurance and with the other
domiciliary directors or commissioners in considering whether to grant the
insurer's request for a waiver.

maintain a risk management framework, conduct an ORSA and file an ORSA summary
report:

determined by the director.

an insurer that qualifies for exemption pursuant to subsection A, paragraph 1
of this section subsequently no longer qualifies for that exemption due to
changes in premium reflected in the insurer's most recent annual statement or
in the most recent annual statements of the insurers within the insurance group

threshold is exceeded to comply with the requirement of this article.END_STATUTE
