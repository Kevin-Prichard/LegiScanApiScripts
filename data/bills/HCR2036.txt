A CONCURRENT RESOLUTION

proclaiming May 1
of each year as Loyalty Day in the State of Arizona.


(TEXT OF BILL BEGINS ON NEXT PAGE)





Whereas, in 1958, the United States Congress designated May 1
of each year as Loyalty Day; and
Whereas, Loyalty Day was established as a day for citizens to
reaffirm their loyalty to the United States and the documents on which this
nation was founded; and
Whereas, dedicated American citizenship is expressed through
our devotion to the safeguarding of our freedoms and our readiness to defend
our country against all enemies within and without; and
Whereas, it is fitting that the citizens of Arizona take time
to reflect on the privileges of democracy and liberty extended to us by the
institutions of American freedom.
Therefore
Be it resolved by the House of Representatives of the State of
Arizona, the Senate concurring:
1.That the Members of the Legislature proclaim May
1 of each year as Loyalty Day in the State of Arizona.
2.That the Members of the Legislature reaffirm
their allegiance to the United States and the flag of the United States.
3.That the Members of the Legislature support the
efforts of the people of this state to observe Loyalty Day by proudly
displaying the United States flag as a clear manifestation of their loyalty and
patriotism.
