attorney shall verify the work authorization of the alleged unauthorized alien

three year probationary period for the business location where the unauthorized
alien performed work. During the probationary period the employer shall file
quarterly reports in the form provided in section 23722.01 with the
county attorney of each new employee who is hired by the employer at the
business location where the unauthorized alien performed work.
(c)Shall order the employer to file a signed sworn
affidavit with the county attorney within three business days after the order
is issued.The affidavit shall state that the employer has
terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this state and that the
employer will not intentionally or knowingly employ an unauthorized alien in
this state. The court shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all
licenses subject to this subdivision that are held by the employer if the
employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county attorney within
three business days after the order is issued.All licenses that are
suspended under this subdivision shall remain suspended until the employer
files a signed sworn affidavit with the county attorney. Notwithstanding any other
law, on filing of the affidavit the suspended licenses shall be reinstated
immediately by the appropriate agencies. For the purposes of this subdivision,
the licenses that are subject to suspension under this subdivision are all
licenses that are held by the employer specific to the business location where
the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer does not hold a license
specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien performed work,
but a license is necessary to operate the employer's business in general, the
licenses that are subject to suspension under this subdivision are all licenses
that are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of business. On
receipt of the court's order and notwithstanding any other law, the appropriate
agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's order. The court
shall send a copy of the court's order to the attorney general and the attorney
general shall maintain the copy pursuant to subsection G of this section.

all licenses described in subdivision (c) of this paragraph that are held by
the employer for not to exceed

days. The court shall base its decision to suspend under this subdivision on
any evidence or information submitted to it during the action for a violation
of this subsection and shall consider the following factors, if relevant:
(i)The number of unauthorized aliens employed by
the employer.
(ii)Any prior misconduct by the employer.
(iii)The degree of harm resulting from the
violation.

comply with any applicable requirements.
(v)The duration of the violation.
(vi)The role of the directors, officers or
principals of the employer in the violation.
(vii)Any other factors the court deems appropriate.
2.For a second violation, as described in paragraph
3 of this subsection, the court shall order the appropriate agencies to
permanently revoke all licenses that are held by the employer specific to the
business location where the unauthorized alien performed work. If the employer
does not hold a license specific to the business location where the
unauthorized alien performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the employer's
business in general, the court shall order the appropriate agencies to
permanently revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the employer's
primary place of business.On receipt of the order and
notwithstanding any other law, the appropriate agencies shall immediately
revoke the licenses.
3.The violation shall be considered:
(a)A first violation by an employer at a business
location if the violation did not occur during a probationary period ordered by
the court under this subsection or section 23212.01, subsection F for
that employer's business location.
(b)A second violation by an employer at a business
location if the violation occurred during a probationary period ordered by the
court under this subsection or section 23212.01, subsection F for that
employer's business location.

court orders that are received pursuant to subsection F of this section and
shall maintain a database of the employers and business locations that have a
first violation of subsection A of this section and make the court orders
available on the attorney general's website.
H.On determining whether an employee is an
unauthorized alien, the court shall consider only the federal government's
determination pursuant to 8 United States Code section 1373(c). The federal
government's determination creates a rebuttable presumption of the employee's
lawful status. The court may take judicial notice of the federal government's
determination and may request the federal government to provide automated or
testimonial verification pursuant to 8 United States Code section 1373(c).
I.For the purposes of this section, proof of verifying an employer that verifies the employment
authorization of an employee through the everify program creates a rebuttable presumption that an employer did not
knowingly employ an unauthorized alienis immune from civil liability and is not subject to
suit pursuant to this section for any act that results in a violation of
subsection A of this section.
J.For the purposes of this section, an employer
that establishes that it has complied in good faith with the requirements of 8
United States Code section 1324a(b) establishes an affirmative defense that the
employer did not knowingly employ an unauthorized alien. An employer is
considered to have complied with the requirements of 8 United States Code
section 1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic or accidental technical
or procedural failure to meet the requirements, if there is a good faith
attempt to comply with the requirements.
K.It is an affirmative defense to a violation of
subsection A of this section that the employer was entrapped.To
claim entrapment, the employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other
evidence the substantial elements of the violation. An employer who asserts an
entrapment defense has the burden of proving the following by a preponderance
of the evidence:
1.The idea of committing the violation started with
law enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the employer.
2.The law enforcement officers or their agents
urged and induced the employer to commit the violation.
3.The employer was not predisposed to commit the
violation before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and induced
the employer to commit the violation.
L.An employer does not establish entrapment if the
employer was predisposed to violate subsection A of this section and the law
enforcement officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an
opportunity to commit the violation. It is not entrapment for law enforcement
officers or their agents merely to use a ruse or to conceal their
identity.The conduct of law enforcement officers and their agents
may be considered in determining if an employer has proven entrapment. END_STATUTE
