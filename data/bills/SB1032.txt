Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Arizona:
Section1.Section
16-411, Arizona Revised Statutes, is amended to read:
START_STATUTE16-411.Designation of election precincts and polling places;
voting centers; electioneering; wait times
A.Except as prescribed by subsection J of this section,
The board of supervisors of each county, on or before December 1 of each year
preceding the year of a general election, by an order, shall establish a
convenient number of election precincts in the county and define the boundaries
of the precincts.The election precinct boundaries shall be so
established as included within election districts prescribed by law for elected
officers of the state and its political subdivisions including community
college district precincts, except those elected officers provided for in
titles 30 and 48.
B.Not less than twenty
days before a general or primary election, and at least ten days before a
special election, the board shall designate one polling place within each
precinct where the election shall be held, except that:
1.On a specific finding
of the board, included in the order or resolution designating polling places
pursuant to this subsection, that no suitable polling place is available within
a precinct, a polling place for that precinct may be designated within an adjacent
precinct.
2.Adjacent precincts
may be combined if boundaries so established are included in election districts
prescribed by law for state elected officials and political subdivisions
including community college districts but not including elected officials
prescribed by titles 30 and 48. The officer in charge of elections may also
split a precinct for administrative purposes. The polling places shall be
listed in separate sections of the order or resolution.
3.On a
specific finding of the board that the number of persons who are listed as
permanent early voters pursuant to section 16544 is likely to
substantially reduce the number of voters appearing at one or more specific
polling places at that election, adjacent precincts may be consolidated by
combining polling places and precinct boards for that election. The board of
supervisors shall ensure that a reasonable and adequate number of polling
places will be designated for that election. Any consolidated polling places
shall be listed in separate sections of the order or resolution of the board.

3.The board shall designate at least one-half of the
total number of the county's precincts for the use of electronic media poll
lists, registers and signature rosters.
4.On a specific resolution of the board, The board may shall
authorize the use of voting centers in place of or in addition to
specifically designated polling places.A voting center shall allow
any voter in that county to receive the appropriate ballot for that voter on
election day and lawfully cast the ballot.Voting centers may be
established in coordination and consultation with the county recorder, at other
county offices or at other locations in the county deemed appropriate.
C.If the board fails to
designate the place for holding the election, or if it cannot be held at or
about the place designated, the justice of the peace in the precinct, two days
before the election, by an order, copies of which the justice of the peace
shall immediately post in three public places in the precinct, shall designate
the place within the precinct for holding the election.If there is
no justice of the peace in the precinct, or if the justice of the peace fails
to do so, the election board of the precinct shall designate and give notice of
the place within the precinct of holding the election.For any
election in which there are no candidates for elected office appearing on the
ballot, the board may consolidate polling places and precinct boards and may
consolidate the tabulation of results for that election if all of the following
apply:
1.All affected voters
are notified by mail of the change at least thirtythree days before the
election.
2.Notice of the change
in polling places includes notice of the new voting location, notice of the
hours for voting on election day and notice of the telephone number to call for
voter assistance.
3.All affected voters
receive information on early voting that includes the application used to
request an early voting ballot.
D.The board is not
required to designate a polling place for special district mail ballot
elections held pursuant to article 8.1 of this chapter, but the board may
designate one or more sites for voters to deposit marked ballots until 7:00
p.m. on the day of the election.
E.Except as provided in
subsection F of this section, a public school shall provide sufficient space
for use as a polling place for any city, county or state election when
requested by the officer in charge of elections.
F.The principal of the
school may deny a request to provide space for use as a polling place for any
city, county or state election if, within two weeks after a request has been
made, the principal provides a written statement indicating a reason the
election cannot be held in the school, including any of the following:
1.Space is not
available at the school.
2.The safety or welfare
of the children would be jeopardized.
G.The board shall make
available to the public as a public record a list of the polling places for all
precincts in which the election is to be held including identification of
polling place changes that were submitted to the United States department of
justice for approval.
H.Except in the case of
an emergency, any facility that is used as a polling place on election day or
that is used as an early voting site during the period of early voting shall
allow persons to electioneer and engage in other political activity outside of
the seventyfive foot limit prescribed by section 16515 in public
areas and parking lots used by voters.This subsection shall not be
construed to permit the temporary or permanent construction of structures in
public areas and parking lots or the blocking or other impairment of access to
parking spaces for voters.The county recorder or other officer in
charge of elections shall post on its website at least two weeks before
election day a list of those polling places in which emergency conditions
prevent electioneering and shall specify the reason the emergency designation
was granted and the number of attempts that were made to find a polling place
before granting an emergency designation.If the polling place is
not on the website list of polling places with emergency designations,
electioneering and other political activity shall be permitted outside of the
seventyfive foot limit. If an emergency arises after the county
recorder or other officer in charge of elections' initial website posting, the
county recorder or other officer in charge of elections shall update the
website as soon as is practicable to include any new polling places, shall
highlight the polling place location on the website and shall specify the
reason the emergency designation was granted and the number of attempts that
were made to find a polling place before granting an emergency designation.
I.For the purposes of
this section, a county recorder or other officer in charge of elections shall
designate a polling place as an emergency polling place and thus prohibit
persons from electioneering and engaging in other political activity outside of
the seventy-five foot limit prescribed by section 16515 but inside the
property of the facility that is hosting the polling place if any of the
following occurs:
1.An act of god renders
a previously set polling place as unusable.
2.A county recorder or
other officer in charge of elections has exhausted all options and there are no
suitable facilities in a precinct that are willing to be a polling place unless
a facility can be given an emergency designation.
J.The secretary of state
shall provide through the instructions and procedures manual adopted pursuant
to section 16452 the maximum allowable wait time for any election that
is subject to section 16204 and provide for a method to reduce voter
wait time at the polls in the primary and general elections.The
method shall consider at least all of the following for primary and general
elections in each precinct:
1.The number of ballots
voted in the prior primary and general elections.
2.The number of
registered voters who voted early in the prior primary and general elections.
3.The number of
registered voters and the number of registered voters who cast an early ballot
for the current primary or general election.
4.The number of
election board members and clerks and the number of rosters that will reduce
voter wait time at the polls.
K.The
board of supervisors of a county shall not change precinct lines during the
period after July 31, 2008 and before January 1, 2011. The board of
supervisors may subdivide an election precinct for administrative purposes or
may provide for more than one polling place within the boundaries of the
election precincts established for use in voting in elections held after July
31, 2008 and before January 1, 2011. In providing for multiple polling places
within a precinct, the board of supervisors shall consider the particular
population characteristics of each precinct in order to provide the voters the
most reasonable access to the polls possible. END_STATUTE

inspector, one marshal, two judges and as many clerks of election as deemed
necessary.The inspector, marshal, judges and clerks shall be
qualified voters of the precinct for which appointed, unless there is not a
sufficient number of persons available to provide the number of appointments
required.The inspector, marshal and judges shall not have changed

the two largest political parties, the marshal in that precinct shall be a
member of the other of the two largest political parties. Whenever possible,
any person appointed as an inspector shall have had previous experience as an
inspector, judge, marshal or clerk of elections. If there is no qualified
person in a given precinct, the appointment of an inspector may be made from
names provided by the county party chairman.If not less than ninety
days before the election the chairman of the county committee of either of the
parties designates qualified voters of the precinct, or of another precinct if
there are not sufficient members of his party available in the precinct to
provide the necessary representation on the election board as judge, such
designated qualified voters shall be appointed.The judges, together
with the inspector, shall constitute the board of elections.Any
registered voter in the election precinct, or in another election precinct if
there are not sufficient persons available in the election precinct for which
the clerks are being appointed, may be appointed as clerk.
B.Before the appointment of election workers pursuant to
subsection A of this section, The county officer in charge of elections shall
review the needs of each precinct to determine whether each precinct is likely
to comply with a thirty minute maximum allowable wait time at the polling place
for that precinct.The officer in charge of elections shall do all
of the following:
1.Determine for each precinct whether bilingual board
workers would reduce likely voter wait times at the polling place and the
number of bilingual board workers needed for that purpose in each precinct.
2.Determine for each precinct the likely voter turnout
for that precinct, including the number of persons likely to vote with early
ballots, the number of provisional ballots cast by voters in that precinct and
the likely effect on wait times for that precinct.
3.Determine for each precinct whether a revision to
precinct lines and polling place locations would adequately reduce wait times
for voters in each precinct.
4.Hold a hearing at least one hundred twenty days before
an election to consider a plan that incorporates the use of additional
bilingual board workers and revisions to precinct lines and locations of
polling places in order to reduce wait times.

of the precinct located within the district, without consideration for
political party.

election precinct consists of three hundred fifty or more qualified electors,
the board of supervisors may in addition to the board of elections appoint a
similar board to be known as the tally board. The tally board shall take

ballots is completed.The tally board shall consist of the inspector
of the board of elections, two judges and not less than two
clerks.The inspector and two judges shall be appointed to provide
as equal as practicable representation of members of the two largest political
parties on the board in the same manner as provided for the election
boards.Any registered voter in the election precinct, or in another
election precinct if there are not sufficient persons available in the election
precinct for which the clerks are being appointed, may be appointed as
clerk.A member appointed to serve on the tally board, with the
