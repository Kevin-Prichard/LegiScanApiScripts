A CONCURRENT RESOLUTION

proclaiming September as Grandfamily/Kinship Care Month in
Arizona.

(TEXT OF BILL BEGINS ON NEXT PAGE)





Whereas, approximately
2.9 million children in America are being raised by their grandparents or other
relatives in kinship care, including 73,000 children in Arizona; and
Whereas, kinship
caregivers not only ensure better outcomes for the children in their care by
keeping them out of the foster care system, but they also save the government
hundreds of millions of dollars each year; and
Whereas, since
relationships with family members are crucial for the healthy development of
children, the State of Arizona should strive to promote and preserve kinship,
sibling and other familial connections for Arizona's children; and
Whereas, during the
month of September, Grandfamily/Kinship Care Month is observed across the
United States; and
Whereas, the State of
Arizona is proud to recognize grandparents and other relatives who raise
children in kinship care to ensure their safety and promote their well-being.
Therefore
Be it resolved by the Senate of the State of Arizona, the House
of Representatives concurring:
That the Members of
the Legislature proclaim the month of September as Grandfamily/Kinship Care
Month in Arizona and honor grandparents and other relatives who raise children
in kinship care.
