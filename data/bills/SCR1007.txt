A CONCURRENT RESOLUTION

proclaiming
January 21, 2016 as Arizona Veteran Family Adoption Program Day.

(TEXT OF BILL BEGINS ON NEXT PAGE)





Whereas, there
are many Arizona children in foster care with a case plan goal of adoption
without identified adoptive families; and
Whereas, every child
deserves the opportunity to grow up in a loving, stable family; and
Whereas, military
veterans can be tremendously effective and successful adoptive parents due to
their life experiences, education and military training; and
Whereas, the Arizona
Veteran Family Adoption Program seeks to help match foster children with
veteran families in Arizona; and
Whereas, the Arizona
Veteran Family Adoption Program is executed at no cost to this state; and
Whereas, with the
support of the community and agencies of this state, including the Department
of Economic Security, the Department of Child Safety and the Department of
Veterans' Services, the Arizona Veteran Family Adoption Program will serve to
reduce the number of foster children in Arizona; and
Whereas,
Arizona's future depends on today's children, and the people of this state are
committed to helping foster children grow and develop to their full potential.
Therefore
Be it resolved by the Senate of the State of Arizona, the House
of Representatives concurring:
1.That
the Members of the Legislature proclaim January 21, 2016 as Arizona Veteran
Family Adoption Program Day in recognition of the program's noble mission to
reduce the number of foster children in Arizona by matching them with loving
and supportive veteran families.
2.That
the Members of the Legislature applaud efforts by the communities and agencies
of this state to support the Arizona Veteran Family Adoption Program.
