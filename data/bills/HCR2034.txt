A CONCURRENT RESOLUTION

proclaiming
February 2 through February 8, 2016 as Chicano History Week in Arizona.

(TEXT OF BILL BEGINS ON NEXT PAGE)





Whereas, the date that
the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was signed, February 2, 1848, is commonly
regarded as the birth date of Chicanos; and
Whereas, people
of Mexican origin and descent have greatly contributed to the economy,
development and growth of this state and the nation, serving the arts,
business, media, industry, agriculture, education and society in myriad ways;
and
Whereas, despite
being promised the rights of citizenship by treaty, the early Mexican-Americans
were stripped of their land, homes and property; and
Whereas, the early
Mexican-Americans faced seemingly insurmountable hardships; their basic rights
were denied, their language and culture were suppressed and their opportunities
for employment, education and political representation were thwarted; and
Whereas, as with many
national boundary changes resulting from war treaties, the historical
documentation of the early Mexican-Americans was destroyed and their
constitutional rights were abrogated, leaving them stripped of their dignity,
unique culture and recorded contributions to society; and
Whereas, the presumed
superiority of the conquerors of the MexicanAmerican people resulted in
the promotion of a disparaging image of those of Mexican descent; and
Whereas, historian
Rodolfo Alvarez has divided the development of the Mexican-American segment of
our population into four categories: the pre1900 creation generation,
the migrant generation, which is allied with Mexico by culture, language and
loyalty, the MexicanAmerican generation, consisting of individuals who
regard themselves as American citizens of Mexican descent, and the Chicano
generation of today, which is a combination of, but distinctly separate from,
the previous three; and
Whereas, Chicanos
recognize that they are the result of a unique confluence of histories,
cultures, languages and traditions: the mezcla, which is La Raza; and
Whereas, during the
Chicano Movement of the 1960s and the 1970s, valiant Chicanos and Chicanas
adamantly decried capricious attempts by the dominant Anglo culture to mold
them into a monocultural, monolingual image; and
Whereas, in a complex
and diversified cultural society, it is essential to understand, accept and
appreciate all traditions and lifestyles in order to eliminate prejudice and
the other effects of stereotyping that have plagued our nation for centuries;
and
Whereas, the people of
this state must recognize that the cultural and intellectual development of the
proud Mexican-American people includes not only American accomplishments but
also those of Spanish origin, which predated the first English settlement in
the United States by over half a century.
Therefore
Be it resolved by the House of
Representatives of the State of Arizona, the Senate concurring:
1.That
the Members of the Legislature proclaim February 2 through February 8, 2016 as
Chicano History Week in Arizona to commemorate the signing of the Treaty of
Guadalupe Hidalgo on February 2, 1848.
2.That
the Members of the Legislature extend accolades of tribute, high praise,
appreciation and appropriate recognition to these North Americans and their
descendants whose citizenship, under the terms of the Treaty of Guadalupe
Hidalgo, literally changed overnight from Mexican to American.
