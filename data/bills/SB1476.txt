Statutes, is amended to read:
START_STATUTE36-449.02.Abortion clinics; licensure requirements; rules
A.Beginning on April 1, 2000, an abortion clinic
shall meet the same licensure requirements as prescribed in article 2 of this
chapter for health care institutions.On initial licensure and any
subsequent renewal, an abortion clinic shall submit to the director all
documentation required by this article, including verification that the
clinic's physicians who are required to be available have admitting privileges
at a health care institution as required by section 36449.03, subsection
C, paragraph 3.
B.An abortion clinic that holds an unclassified
health care facility license issued before August 6, 1999 may retain that
classification until April 1, 2000 subject to compliance with all laws that
relate to unclassified health care facilities.
C.Beginning on April 1, 2000, abortion clinics
shall comply with department requirements for abortion clinics and department
rules that govern abortion clinics.
D.If the
director determines that there is reasonable cause to believe an abortion
clinic is not adhering to the licensing requirements of this article or any
other law or rule concerning abortion, the director and any duly designated
employee or agent of the director, including county health representatives and
county or municipal fire inspectors, consistent with standard medical
practices, may enter on and into the premises of the abortion clinic that is
licensed or required to be licensed pursuant to this article during regular
business hours of the abortion clinic to determine compliance with this
article, rules adopted pursuant to this article, local fire ordinances or rules
and any other law or rule relating to abortion.
E.An
application for licensure pursuant to this article constitutes permission for,
and complete acquiescence in, an entry or inspection of the premises during the
pendency of the application and, if licensed, during the term of the license.
F.If an
inspection conducted pursuant to this section reveals that an abortion clinic
is not adhering to the licensing requirements prescribed pursuant to this
article or any other law or rule concerning abortion, the director may take
action authorized by this article.
G.An abortion
clinic whose license has been suspended or revoked pursuant to this article or
section 36424 is subject to inspection on application for relicensure or
reinstatement of the license.
H.In any proceeding in which the
constitutionality, legality or application of this section is challenged, the
attorney general or any county or city attorney who wishes to defend the law
has the right to intervene as a party and is deemed to have proper standing in
the matter.The only objection that may be raised to a motion to
intervene as of right pursuant to this subsection is that the proposed
intervenor does not have a good faith intention to defend the law. Any party
or proposed intervenor may raise this objection.Notwithstanding
section 41192, the department may employ legal counsel and make an
expenditure or incur an indebtedness for legal services for the purposes of
defending this section. END_STATUTE
