START_STATUTE48-576.Resolution or ordinance of intention to order improvement;
election
A.Before ordering an improvement authorized by this
article, the governing body of the municipality shall comply with both of the following:
1.Pass
a resolution or ordinance of intention so to do, briefly describing the
improvement.By the resolution or ordinance and the proceedings
subsequent thereto, one or more improvements may be made on one or more streets
and shall constitute one improvement and be constructed under one or more
contracts.The resolution or ordinance of intention may be combined
in a single resolution or ordinance of intention to open, extend, widen,
straighten or close public streets or off-street parking areas pursuant to
section 48505.If the work proposed is already done for a
lot, the lot shall be excepted from the assessment therefor to the extent of
the work done.
2.If the
governing body determines that the district should be formed after the final
resolution of any protests made pursuant to this article or article 1 of this
chapter, the governing body shall submit the formation to an election of the
owners of land in the district who are qualified electors of this state and
other landowners according to section 483043.Each landowner
has the number of votes or portions of votes equal to the number of acres or
portions of acres rounded upward to the nearest five hundredths of an acre
owned by that owner in the submitted district.In addition to
holding the landowner election required by this paragraph, the governing body
shall submit the formation of the district to a vote of the other qualified
electors who reside within the boundaries of the proposed
district.Only after the approval of a majority of the landowners
voting on the matter and the approval of a majority of the qualified electors
voting on the matter, the governing body may form the improvement district and
order the improvement as otherwise provided by law.
B.When the proposed improvement, in the opinion of
the governing body, is of more than local or ordinary public benefit, it may
order the expense of the improvement chargeable upon a district, and shall
describe the extent of the district in general terms in its resolution or
ordinance of intention, either by reference to street lines or block numbers,
or by designating its exterior boundaries by their courses and distances from
the street or streets the improvement of which is contemplated, and may refer
for a more particular description thereof to a map on file with the city or
town engineer, showing the exterior boundary lines of the district, and
delineating block and lot numbers or containing such details as will show the
location of the lines.A city or town shall not assess the costs of
an improvement which is for the general public benefit against land in an
assessment district.If a portion of the expense of an improvement
is for general public benefit, the city or town shall assess the district only
that portion of the expense which benefits the property within the district.
C.The governing body, in the resolution or
ordinance of intention, may provide that the improvement described therein may
be made according to any of several alternative plans and specifications, or
methods, classes or kinds of construction, or classes and kinds of material to
be thereafter determined by the legislative body. END_STATUTE
