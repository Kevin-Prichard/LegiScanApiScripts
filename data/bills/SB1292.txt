emergency placements; disqualifying criminal offenses; definitions
A.If a
child is removed from the custody of the child's parent, guardian or custodian
pursuant to this article and an emergency placement is offered, the department
or an authorized tribe may request, in accordance with the procedures prescribed
in 28 Code of Federal Regulations sections 901.1 through 901.4, that each
person who is at least eighteen years of age and who is residing in a home
where the potential emergency placement is to be made consent to both of the
following:
1.A
preliminary state and federal name-based background check.
2.Within
fifteen days after the date that the name-based background check is conducted,
the submission of a full set of fingerprints to the department for the purpose
of obtaining a state and federal criminal records check pursuant to section 411750
and Public law 92544. The department of public safety may exchange this
fingerprint data with the federal bureau of investigation.
B.An adult
who consents to name-based and fingerprint background checks pursuant to
subsection A of this section shall submit to the department or an authorized
tribe a full set of fingerprints and written permission authorizing the
department or authorized tribe to submit the fingerprints to the department of
public safety for the processing of the state and federal criminal records
check. The department of public safety shall provide the results of the
name-based and fingerprint background checks to the department or authorized
tribe that submitted the request.
C.If a
name-based background check demonstrates that none of the adults residing in
the home where the emergency placement is to be made has been convicted of a
disqualifying criminal offense, the department or authorized tribe may place
the child in the home pending the outcome of the fingerprint background check.
D.If an
adult refuses to consent to the department's or an authorized tribe's request
for name-based and fingerprint background checks, the department or authorized
tribe may not place the child in a home in which the adult resides or, if the
child was already placed in the home, the department or authorized tribe shall
immediately remove the child from the home. 
E.If the
department or an authorized tribe requests an initial namebased
background check and a fingerprint background check pursuant to this section,
the department or the authorized tribe may not make an emergency placement or
continue an emergency placement in a home in which an adult resident has been
convicted of a disqualifying criminal offense.
F.If an
emergency placement is denied as a result of a name-based background check of
an adult resident and the adult resident contests the denial, the adult
resident, within fifteen calendar days after the denial, may submit to the
department or authorized tribe a complete set of fingerprints for the purpose
of OBTAINing A STATE AND FEDERAL CRIMINAL RECORDS CHECK PURSUANT TO SECTION 411750
AND PUBLIC LAW 92544.
G.The
department shall designate by rule each criminal offense that constitutes a
disqualifying criminal offense under this section. In making this
determination, the department shall at least consider felony convictions for
violent crimes, crimes involving children, family members or elderly or persons
with disabilities and crimes involving drugs within a certain period of time
before the potential emergency placement.
H.For the
purposes of this section:

this state and that has a valid tribal fingerprint program user agreement with
the department of public safety.
2."Emergency
placement" means an instance in which the department or an authorized
tribe provides protective services and places a child in the home of private
individuals, including family, neighbors or friends of the child. END_STATUTE
