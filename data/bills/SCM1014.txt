urging the
Congress of the United States to act to prohibit federal agencies from
recommending and identifying Arizona's public lands as wilderness areas without
express congressional consent.


(TEXT OF BILL BEGINS ON NEXT PAGE)





To the Congress of the United States of America:
Your memorialist respectfully represents:
Whereas, through federal land
management planning and associated guidelines, federal agencies are
recommending and identifying Arizona's public lands as wilderness areas; and
Whereas, these administratively
recommended wilderness areas circumvent congressional intent and lack full and
appropriate National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) analyses; and
Whereas, the identification of
these de facto wilderness areas has resulted in significant restrictions on
public access and recreation, paralyzing restrictions on the Arizona Game and
Fish Department's ability to manage wildlife and potentially catastrophic
restrictions on vegetation and habitat improvement projects, including fire
management activities; and
Whereas, the conservation of
wildlife resources is the trust responsibility of the Arizona Game and Fish
Commission, and this responsibility extends to all lands within Arizona to
ensure abundant wildlife resources for current and future generations; and
Whereas, the designation of
Arizona's public lands as wilderness areas has resulted in the erosion of the
Arizona Game and Fish Department's ability to comply with its federal mandate
to proactively recover threatened and endangered species; and
Whereas, according to federal land
management agency guidelines, an administratively recommended wilderness area
must be managed to "protect and maintain the social and ecological
characteristics that provide the basis for wilderness recommendation" in
perpetuity or until Congress takes action to formally designate the area as a
wilderness area; and
Whereas, allowable activities
within administratively recommended wilderness areas will be left to the
discretion of federal staff and deciding officers, resulting in even greater restrictions
and limitations than those formally vetted and designated by Congress; and
Whereas, congressionally designated
wilderness provides clearer guidance for management and coordination with this
state, specific processes for wildlife management exemptions and direction for
collaboration via existing state agreements and guidelines; and
Whereas, administratively recommended wilderness areas
circumvent the spirit of NEPA and congressional intent and lack transparency;
and
Whereas, with the implementation of federal land management
plans, recommended wilderness areas constitute a significant and immediate
change in management without a fully disclosed impact analysis required by
NEPA; and
Whereas, the federal land
management plans lack full NEPA disclosure of potential impacts to this state
and the public, assurances protecting this state's ability to proactively
manage wildlife and fulfill its public trust responsibility, including specific
management activities, and analyses of the cumulative impacts of further loss
of public lands that provide for multipleuse and wildlife-related
recreational and economic opportunities; and
Whereas, the areas being
recommended as wilderness were not included within the original wilderness
designations with purposeful intent by Congress; and
Whereas, the subsequent expansion
of previously designated wilderness is an overreach of the federal agencies and
disingenuous to the public, subverting original collaboration, coordination,
negotiation and agreements; and
Whereas, the federal agency planning documents suggest that no
significant management action or recommendation to Congress will take place
before further NEPA analyses are completed. Within the recently released
Prescott and Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest recommended wildernesses, the
United States Forest Service indicates that these areas are simply preliminary
administrative recommendations and that further NEPA analyses
arenecessary.However, in transmittal letters, the United
States Forest Service states that "the Final Environmental Impact
Statement for the . . . Forest's Revised Resource Management Plan contains the
NEPA analysis necessary to support a legislative proposal." This is an
egregious lack of transparency.
Wherefore your
memorialist, the Senate of the State of Arizona, the House of Representatives
concurring, prays:
1.That the Congress of
the United States act to prohibit federal agencies from recommending and
identifying Arizona's public lands as wilderness areas without express
congressional consent.
2.That the Secretary of
State of the State of Arizona transmit copies of this Memorial to the President
of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of
Representatives and each Member of Congress from the State of Arizona.
