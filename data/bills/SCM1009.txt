(TEXT OF BILL BEGINS ON NEXT PAGE)





To the Congress of the United States of America:
Your memorialist respectfully represents:
Whereas, the Tucson Postal Processing and Distribution Center
(Cherrybell) serves the entire southern portion of Arizona covering the
counties of Pima, Santa Cruz and Cochise. Currently, Southern Arizona is facing
a potential economic downfall due to the initial decision made by the United
States Postal Service (USPS) Board of Governors to close Cherrybell; and
Whereas, more than 1.8 million people and 23,197 businesses use
the Cherrybell postal services. According to USPS officials, over 3 million
pieces of mail go through Cherrybell each day as it is the 15th
largest facility serving the 33rd largest population area in our
nation. The processing and sorting operations at Cherrybell that are proposed
to be moved to Phoenix affect approximately 280 jobs in Southern Arizona; and  
Whereas, Southern Arizona, which includes both the Tohono
O'odham nation and Pasqua Yaqui tribal lands, encompasses the California and
Arizona border at Yuma south to Nogales, across to Douglas and Bisbee in
Cochise County and the military installations located at Fort Huachuca and
Davis Monthan, depends on the Cherrybell Post office; and
Whereas, Southern Arizona is home
to many military veterans who depend on the USPS both for timely delivery of
medical prescriptions and for employment, as the USPS employs more veterans
than any entity other than the United States Department of Defense; and
Whereas, in an extensive community
survey conducted in 2015, 84% of individuals and 86% of businesses reported a
noticeable delay in mail delivery due to the partial closure of Cherrybell; and
Whereas, Tucson City Council Member Richard Fimbres went on
record opposing the closure of Cherrybell and requested that the Council work
directly with Tucson's congressional delegation and community members to frame
a campaign to protect the vital jobs at Cherrybell; and
Whereas, Pima County Recorder F. Ann Rodriguez objects to the
closure of Cherrybell and firmly believes that, due to the higher number of
voters each year on the permanent early voting list, this change will clearly
impact the activities of the state and county elections officials in Arizona
and will cause a detrimental impact to voters. The information provided to the
public by the USPS is based entirely on economic considerations with no
apparent regard for the impact of the change on the fundamental right of all
citizens to vote and, in particular, the significant additional detrimental
impact to Native American voters in the region; and
Whereas, the people of Arizona
applaud the efforts of United States Representative Martha McSally and the
other members of the Arizona Congressional Delegation, including
Representatives Trent Franks, Ann Kirkpatrick, Matt Salmon, Paul Gosar, Ruben
Gallego, Kyrsten Sinema and Raul Grijalva, who have asked for more detailed and
complete information regarding the proposal Cherrybell closure; and
Whereas, thousands of people have
written letters and signed online petitions urging the USPS Board of Governors
not to close Cherrybell.
Wherefore your memorialist, the Senate of the State of Arizona,
the House of Representatives concurring, prays:
1.That the Congress of the United States protest
the proposed closing of the Tucson Postal Processing and Distribution Center
and take any action necessary to fully restore operations of this vital postal
facility.
2.That the Secretary of State of the State of
Arizona transmit copies of this Memorial to the President of the United States
Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives and each
Member of Congress from the State of Arizona.
