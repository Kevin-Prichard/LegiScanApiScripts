A CONCURRENT MEMORIAL

urging the

(TEXT OF BILL BEGINS ON NEXT PAGE)





To the Congress of the United States of America:
Your memorialist respectfully represents:
Whereas, on April 13, 2015, Representative Bill Shuster
introduced H.R.1732, the Regulatory Integrity Protection Act; and
Whereas, the Regulatory Integrity Protection Act protects
landowners from intrusive government regulation and ensures the protection of
personal property; and
Whereas, the Regulatory Integrity Protection Act came in
response to efforts by the Obama Administration, the United States
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the United States Army Corps of
Engineers to implement the Clean Water Rule, which vastly expands the federal
government's ability to regulate waterways; and
Whereas, the final rule became effective on August 28, 2015;
and
Whereas, the final rule is far too broad, allowing the federal
government to regulate everything from puddles of rainwater to agricultural
irrigation systems; and
Whereas, the final rule allows waters that have traditionally
been off limits to federal regulation to be subject to the rulemaking process
of the EPA and the Clean Water Act; and
Whereas, the customs, cultures and
economic well-being of our local communities, as well as important historic and
cultural aspects of our local heritage, are being ignored, which adversely
affects the lives and jobs of the people of the United States and devastates
local and state economies; and
Whereas, the State of Arizona is
one of 27 states that have brought legal challenges against the Clean Water
Rule and successfully obtained a nationwide stay barring the rule's
enforcement; and
Whereas, if passed by Congress, the
Regulatory Integrity Protection Act would require the EPA and the United States
Army Corps of Engineers to develop a new rule that takes into consideration all
public comments received on the matter as well as input received from state and
local governments.
Wherefore your
memorialist, the Senate of the State of Arizona, the House of Representatives
concurring, prays:
1.That the Congress of
the United States enact the Regulatory Integrity Protection Act.
2.That the Secretary of
State of the State of Arizona transmit copies of this Memorial to the President
of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of
Representatives and each Member of Congress from the State of Arizona.
