general proposed rules consistent with the procurement practices prescribed in
title 41, chapter 23, modifying the provisions for public notice of invitation
for bids, requests for proposals and requests for qualifications to allow a
governing board to give public notice of the invitation for bids, requests for

rules shall include provisions specifying that school districts are not required
to engage in competitive bidding in order to make the decision to participate
in programs pursuant to section 15382 and that a program authorized by
section 15382 is not required to engage in competitive bidding for the
services necessary to administer the program or for purchase of insurance or
reinsurance.The rules shall include provisions specifying that
school districts are not required to engage in competitive bidding in order to
place a pupil in a private school that provides special education services if
such placement is prescribed in the pupil's individualized education program
and the private school has been approved by the department of education
division of special education pursuant to section 15765, subsection
D.This placement is not subject to rules adopted by the state board
of education before November 24, 2009 pursuant to this section. The rules for
procurement of construction projects shall include provisions specifying that
surety bonds furnished as bid security and performance and payment bonds shall
be executed and furnished as required by title 34, chapter 2 or 6, as
applicable. The rules shall specify the total cost of a procurement that is

provision of materials, services or construction for charter schools shall be
in writing.
2.The state board of education shall adopt rules
for procurements involving construction not exceeding one hundred fifty
thousand dollars, which shall be known as the simplified school construction
procurement program. At a minimum, the rules for a simplified construction
procurement program shall require that:

superintendent of persons who desire to receive solicitations to bid on
construction projects to which additions shall be permitted throughout the
year.
(b)The list of persons be available for public
inspection.

in, collateral to or affecting a construction contract that makes the contract
subject to the laws of another state or that requires any litigation,

be conducted in another state is against this state's public policy and is void
and unenforceable.
3.The state board of education shall adopt rules
for the procurement of goods and information services by school districts and
charter schools using electronic, online bidding. The rules adopted by the
state board shall include the use of reverse auctions and shall be consistent
with the procurement practices prescribed in title 41, chapter 23, article 13,
modifying as necessary those provisions and the rules adopted pursuant to that
article that the state board determines are not appropriate for school
districts and charter schools. Until the rules are adopted, school districts
and charter schools may procure goods and information services pursuant to
title 41, chapter 23, article 13 using the rules adopted by the department of
administration in implementing that article.

rules to determine whether the rules are consistent with the procurement
practices prescribed in title 41, chapter 23 and any modifications are required
to adapt the procedures for school districts.

rules, the auditor general shall notify the state board in writing and the

qualifications are submitted in response to a request for proposals or a
request for qualifications and the award is made, the governing board shall
make available for public inspection all information, all bids, proposals and
qualifications submitted and all findings and other information considered in
determining whose bid conforms to the invitation for bids and will be the most
advantageous with respect to price, conformity to the specifications and other
factors or whose proposal or qualifications are to be selected for the
award.The invitation for bids, request for proposals or request for
qualifications shall include a notice that all information and bids, proposals
and qualifications submitted will be made available for public inspection. The
rules adopted by the state board shall prohibit the use in connection with
procurement of specifications in any way proprietary to one supplier unless the
specification includes all of the following:

specification is practicable.
2.A description of the essential characteristics of

public accountant, shall contract for a systematic review of purchasing
practices using methodology consistent with sampling guidelines established by
the auditor general.The auditor general shall consider cost when
establishing guidelines pursuant to this subsection and to the extent possible
shall attempt to minimize the cost of the review. The purpose of the review is

United States general services administration contracts for materials and
services. The governing board or governing body may authorize purchases under

for bids or the request for proposals and if monies are available for the first
fiscal period at the time the contract is executed.The duration of
contracts for materials or services and contracts for jobordercontracting
construction services shall be limited to no more than five years unless the
governing board determines in writing before the procurement solicitation is
issued that a contract of longer duration would be advantageous to the school
district. Payment and performance obligations for succeeding fiscal periods
are subject to the availability and appropriation of monies.
L.Notwithstanding the rules adopted by the
stateboard of education, the maximum dollar amount of an
individual job order for jobordercontracting construction
services shall be one million dollars or a higher or lower amount prescribed by
