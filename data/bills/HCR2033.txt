(TEXT OF BILL BEGINS ON NEXT PAGE)





Whereas, the motto of
the State of Arizona is Ditat Deus, which means "God Enriches"; and
Whereas, the State of
Arizona was founded on faith in Divine Providence; and
Whereas, the platform
for living out faith is the local congregation; and
Whereas, the shepherds
of our congregations are our local pastors; and
Whereas, the
designation of a month of appreciation gives the people of this state an
opportunity to honor their pastors for all the work they do to lift up their
communities, families and neighborhoodsphysically, spiritually and
emotionally.
Therefore
Be it resolved by the House of Representatives of the State of
Arizona, the Senate concurring:
That the Members of
the Legislature proclaim October 2016 as Arizona Pastor Appreciation Month.
