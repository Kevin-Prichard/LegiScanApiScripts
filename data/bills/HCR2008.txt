(TEXT OF BILL BEGINS ON NEXT PAGE)





Whereas, the death of a loved one is a devastating experience,
and the murder of a loved one is exceptionally difficult; and
Whereas, the friends and families of murder victims cope with
grief through a variety of support services, including counseling, crisis
intervention, professional referrals and assistance in dealing with the
criminal justice system; and
Whereas, the designation of a day of remembrance for murder
victims provides an opportunity for the people of this state to honor the
memories of murder victims and to recognize the impact of their loss on
surviving family members.
Therefore
Be it resolved by the House of Representatives of the State of
Arizona, the Senate concurring:
That the Members of the Legislature join the rest of the
country and proclaim September 25, 2016 as Arizona Day of Remembrance for
Murder Victims.
