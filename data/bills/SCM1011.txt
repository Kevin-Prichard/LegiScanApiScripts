A CONCURRENT MEMORIAL

urging the
Congress of the United States to enact the Resilient Federal Forests Act.


(TEXT OF BILL BEGINS ON NEXT PAGE)





To the Congress of the United States of America:
Your memorialist respectfully represents:
Whereas, national forest lands are the largest single source of
water in the United States and, in some regions of the west, contribute nearly
50% of the overall water supply; and
Whereas, the unhealthy state of these forests has resulted in
catastrophic wildfires that are threatening the reliability, volume and quality
of water for tens of millions of Americans; and
Whereas, severe drought and record-breaking wildfire seasons
have highlighted the need for the implementation of a process that would
require and provide for the United States Forest Service to accelerate
restoration work in our national forests, which would protect critical
headwaters and make forest lands more resilient against prolonged dry
conditions, insect infestation and fire; and
Whereas, failure to take quick action will result in a
continued increase in the frequency and intensity of destructive wildfires,
impacting the nation's water resources for decades at considerable cost to
stakeholders and United States taxpayers; and
Whereas, the customs, cultures and economic well-being of our
local communities, as well as important historic and cultural aspects of our
local heritage, are being ignored, which adversely affects the lives and jobs
of the people of the United States and devastates local and state economies;
and
Whereas, on June 4, 2015, Representative Bruce Westerman introduced
H.R. 2647, the Resilient Federal Forests Act. The bill passed in the House on
July 9, 2015 and was transmitted to the Senate, where it died in committee; and
Whereas, the Resilient Federal
Forests Act expedites and improves forest management activities through a
collaborative process, resulting in the protection of water resources.
Wherefore your
memorialist, the Senate of the State of Arizona, the House of Representative
concurring, prays:
1.That the United States Congress enact the
Resilient Federal Forests Act.
2.That the Secretary of State of the State of
Arizona transmit copies of this Memorial to the President of the United States
Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives and each
Member of Congress from the State of Arizona.
