biennial audit schedule if the previous annual audit did not contain any
significant negative findings.If a biennial audit of a school
district conducted pursuant to this subsection contains any significant
negative findings, the school district shall convert back to an annual audit
schedule.If a school district is required to convert back to an
annual audit schedule pursuant to this subsection because of significant
negative findings, the school district may subsequently convert to a biennial
audit schedule if the previous two annual audits did not contain any
significant negative findings.For the purposes of this subsection,
"significant negative finding" means a finding that results in the
issuance of a letter of noncompliance from the auditor general.
