A CONCURRENT RESOLUTION

applying to the
congress of the united states to call a convention for proposing amendments to
the constitution of the united states.


(TEXT OF BILL BEGINS ON NEXT PAGE)





Whereas, Article II, section 1, clause 5 of the Constitution
of the United States, provides in part that "[n]o person except a natural
born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of
this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of President;" and
Whereas, the Twelfth Amendment to the Constitution of the
United States further provides that "no person constitutionally ineligible
to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice-President of the
United States;" and
Whereas, the Heritage Foundation states that during the Constitutional
Convention, John Jay wrote to George Washington, urging "a strong check to
the admission of Foreigners into the administration of our national Government;
and to declare expressly that the Commander in Chief of the American army shall
not be given to nor devolve on, any but a natural born Citizen." Justice
Story later noted that the natural born citizenship requirement "cuts off
all chances for ambitious foreigners, who might otherwise be intriguing for the
office;" and
Whereas, the Constitution of the United States does not define
the term "natural born citizen," which has, in turn, created ongoing
debate and differing opinions regarding the precise meaning of this bedrock
constitutional principle.
Therefore
Be it resolved by the House of Representatives of the State of
Arizona, the Senate concurring:
1.That, pursuant to Article V of the Constitution
of the United States, the Legislature of the State of Arizona formally applies
to the Congress of the United States to call a convention of the states limited
to proposing amendments to the Constitution of the United States that define
the term "natural born citizen."
2.That this application constitutes a continuing
application in accordance with Article V of the Constitution of the United
States until at least two-thirds of the legislatures of the several states have
made application on the same subjects.
3.That this application is revoked, withdrawn,
nullified and superseded, retroactive to the date of enactment, if the
application is used for the purpose of calling a convention or is used in
support of conducting a convention to amend the Constitution of the United
States for any purpose other than to define the term "natural born
citizen."
4.That the Secretary of State of the State of Arizona
transmit a copy of this Resolution to the President and Secretary of the United
States Senate, the Speaker and Clerk of the United States House of
Representatives, each Member of Congress from the State of Arizona and the
presiding officers of each house of the several state legislatures, requesting
their cooperation.
