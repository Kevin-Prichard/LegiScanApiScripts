the Arizona rules of civil procedure within one hundred eighty days after the

permit the public entity, public school or public employee to understand the
basis on which liability is claimed.The claim shall also contain a
specific amount for which the claim can be settled and the facts supporting

days after the cause of action accrues is barred and no action may be
maintained thereon.

C.Notwithstanding subsection A of this section, any claim that must be
submitted to a binding or nonbinding dispute resolution process or an

term shall not accrue for the purposes of this section until all such
procedures, processes or remedies have been exhausted.The time in
which to give notice of a potential claim and to sue on the claim shall run
from the date on which a final decision or notice of disposition is issued in
