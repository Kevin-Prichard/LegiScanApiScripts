Statutes, is amended to read:
START_STATUTE20-259.01.Motor vehicle liability policy; uninsured optional;
underinsured optional; subrogation; medical payments liens; definitions
A.Every insurer writing automobile liability or
motor vehicle liability policies shall make available to the named insured
thereunder and by written notice offer the insured and at the request of the
insured shall include within the policy uninsured motorist coverage which that extends to and covers all persons insured
under the policy, in limits not less than the liability limits for bodily
injury or death contained within the policy.The selection of limits
or rejection of coverage by a named insured or applicant on a form approved by
the director is valid for all insureds under the policy.an insurance producer that uses such a form in
offering uninsured motorist coverage and confirming the selection of limits or
rejection of coverage by a named insured or applicant satisfies the insurance
producer's standard of care in offering and explaining the nature and
applicability of uninsured motorist coverage. A named insured's selection of limits or rejection of
uninsured motorist coverage on a form approved by the director constitutes the
final expression of the named insured's decision to purchase or reject
uninsured motorist coverage and may not be contradicted by evidence of any
prior communications between the named insured and the named insured's
insurance producer or insurer concerning the named insured's desire to purchase
uninsured motorist coverage.The completion of such
form is not required where the insured purchases such coverage in an amount
equal to the limits for bodily injury or death contained in the policy. The
offer need not be made in the event of the reinstatement of a lapsed policy or
the transfer, substitution, modification or renewal of an existing
policy.At the request of the insured, the insured may purchase and
the insurer shall then include within the policy uninsured motorist coverage
that extends to and covers all persons insured under the policy in any amount
up to the liability limits for bodily injury or death contained within the
policy but not less than the limits prescribed in section 284009.
B.Every insurer writing automobile liability or
motor vehicle liability policies shall also make available to the named insured
thereunder and shall by written notice offer the insured and at the request of
the insured shall include within the policy underinsured motorist coverage which that extends to and covers all persons insured
under the policy, in limits not less than the liability limits for bodily
injury or death contained within the policy.The selection of limits
or rejection of coverage by a named insured or applicant on a form approved by
the director shall be valid for all insureds under the policy.an insurance producer that uses such a form in
offering underinsured motorist coverage and confirming the selection of limits
or rejection of coverage by a named insured or applicant satisfies the
insurance producer's standard of care in offering and explaining the nature and
applicability of underinsured motorist coverage. A named insured's selection of limits or rejection of
underinsured motorist coverage on a form approved by the director constitutes
the final expression of the named insured's decision to purchase or reject
underinsured motorist coverage and may not be contradicted by evidence of any
prior communications between the named insured and the named insured's
insurance producer or insurer concerning the named insured's desire to purchase
underinsured motorist coverage.The completion of such
form is not required where the insured purchases such coverage in an amount
equal to the limits for bodily injury or death contained in the
policy.The offer need not be made in the event of the reinstatement
of a lapsed policy or the transfer, substitution, modification or renewal of an
existing policy.At the request of the insured, the insured may
purchase and the insurer shall then include within the policy underinsured
motorist coverage that extends to and covers all persons insured under the
policy in any amount authorized by the insured up to the liability limits for
bodily injury or death contained within the policy.
C.Any insurer writing automobile liability or motor
vehicle liability policies may make available the coverages required by
subsections A and B of this section to owners and operators of motor vehicles
that are used as public or livery conveyances or rented to others or that are
used in the business primarily to transport property or equipment.The provisions of Subsections A
and B of this section shall
do not preclude an
insurer writing automobile liability or motor vehicle liability policies in
this state from requiring that all motor vehicles that are owned by or
registered to the named insured and that are insured by the same insurer or
group of insurers under a common management have the same limits of coverage
for uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage in amounts as selected or
rejected by the named insured.
D."Uninsured motor vehicles", subject to
the terms and conditions of that coverage, includes any insured motor vehicle
if the liability insurer of the vehicle is unable to make payment on the liability
of its insured, within the limits of the coverage, because of insolvency.
E."Uninsured motorist coverage", subject
to the terms and conditions of that coverage, means coverage for damages due to
bodily injury or death if the motor vehicle that caused the bodily injury or
death is not insured by a motor vehicle liability policy that contains at least
the limits prescribed in section 284009.For the purposes of
uninsured motorist coverage, an uninsured motorist does not include a person
who is insured under a motor vehicle liability policy that complies with
section 284009.
F.Any payment made under the bodily injury
liability portion of a motor vehicle liability policy insuring the motor
vehicle that caused the bodily injury or death in an amount equal to or less
than the per person or per occurrence bodily injury limits of that policy,
regardless of the number of persons receiving payments, precludes any payment
under the uninsured motorist coverage based upon on
the fault of the person who is insured under the motor vehicle
liability policy.
G."Underinsured motorist coverage"
includes coverage for a person if the sum of the limits of liability under all
bodily injury or death liability bonds and liability insurance policies
applicable at the time of the accident is less than the total damages for
bodily injury or death resulting from the accident.To the extent
that the total damages exceed the total applicable liability limits, the
underinsured motorist coverage provided in subsection B of this section is
applicable to the difference.
H.Uninsured and underinsured motorist coverages are
separate and distinct and apply to different accident
situations.Underinsured motorist coverage shall not provide
coverage for a claim against an uninsured motorist in addition to any
applicable uninsured motorist coverage.If multiple policies or
coverages purchased by one insured on different vehicles apply to an accident
or claim, the insurer may limit the coverage so that only one policy or coverage,
selected by the insured, shall be applicable to any one accident.If
the policy does not contain a statement that informs the insured of the
insured's right to select one policy or coverage as required by this
subsection, within thirty days after the insurer receives notice of an
accident, the insurer shall notify the insured in writing of the insured's
right to select one policy or coverage.For the purposes of this
subsection, "insurer" includes every insurer within a group of
insurers under a common management.
I.Insurers that make payments for damages to
insureds for uninsured motorist coverage may subrogate and sue for
reimbursement of the total amount of the payments in the name of the insured
against any uninsured motorist responsible for the damages to the insured.
J.Any automobile liability or motor vehicle
liability insurer that makes a payment under the medical payments coverage of a
motor vehicle insurance policy to or on behalf of any insured for an injury
that arises out of an accident that occurs after December 31, 1998 may have a
lien against any amount in excess of five thousand dollars that is paid to or
on behalf of that insured under the medical payments coverage of the policy for
that accident.The insurer shall compromise the lien in a fair and
equitable manner.In order to perfect a lien granted pursuant to
this subsection, within sixty days after issuing a payment that is more than
five thousand dollars to the insured under medical payments coverage, the
insurer or the insurer's authorized representative shall record in the office
of the recorder of the county in which the accident occurred a written
statement that sets forth the name and address of the insured as they appear in
the records of the insurer, the name and address of the insurer at the
insurer's principal office in this state, the amount claimed pursuant to this
subsection and, to the best of the insurer's knowledge, the names and addresses
of all persons, firms and corporations and their insurance carriers that the
insured or the insured's legal representative alleges are liable for damages
arising from the accident.Within five days after recording the
lien, the insurer shall also mail a copy of the lien, postage prepaid, to the
insured and to each person, firm and corporation and their insurance carriers
alleged to be liable for damages at the address given in the
statement.The recording of the lien is notice of the lien to all
persons, firms and corporations that are liable for damages regardless of
whether they are named in the lien.The recorder shall endorse on
the lien recorded pursuant to this subsection the date and hour of receipt and
all facts that are necessary to indicate that the lien has been
recorded.The lien may be amended to reflect payments to the insured
made after the lien is recorded.Within thirty days after the lien
is satisfied, the lienholder shall issue and record a release of the lien.
K.Any common law prohibition against assignments of
causes of action for personal injuries is abrogated to the extent provided in
subsection I of this section.
L.An insurer is not required to offer, provide or
make available coverage conforming to this section in connection with any
general commercial liability policy, excess policy, umbrella policy or other
policy that does not provide primary motor vehicle insurance for liabilities
arising out of the ownership, maintenance, operation or use of a specifically
insured motor vehicle.
M.If an insured makes a bodily injury or death
claim under uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage based on an accident
that involved an unidentified motor vehicle and no physical contact with the
motor vehicle occurred, the insured shall provide corroboration that the
unidentified motor vehicle caused the accident.For the purposes of
this subsection, "corroboration" means any additional and confirming
testimony, fact or evidence that strengthens and adds weight or credibility to
the insured's representation of the accident.END_STATUTE
