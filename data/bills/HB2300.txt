(TEXT OF BILL BEGINS ON NEXT PAGE)





Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Arizona:
Section1.Title 13, chapter 31, Arizona
Revised Statutes, is amended by adding section 13-3122, to read:
START_STATUTE13-3122.Second amendment violations; prohibited activities; state
treasurer; prohibited money transfers; civil penalties; classification

any other law and except as required by a court order, an agency of this state

Sec.2.Legislative findings
A.The legislature finds:
1.The right to keep and bear arms is a fundamental
individual right that shall not be infringed.
2.That it is the intent of the legislature in
enacting this act to protect Arizona employees, including law enforcement
officers, from being directed, through federal executive orders, agency orders,
statutes, laws, rules or regulations enacted or promulgated on or after the
effective date of this act to violate their oath of office and individual
rights affirmed under the second amendment to the Constitution of the United
States and article II, section 26, Constitution of Arizona.
3.That pursuant to and in furtherance of the
principles of federalism enshrined in the Constitution of the United States,
the federal government may not commandeer this state's officers, agents or
employees to participate in the enforcement or facilitation of any federal
program not expressly required by the Constitution of the United States.
4.That this right to be free from the commandeering
hand of the federal government has been most notably recognized by the United
States Supreme Court in Printz v. United States when the Court held,
"The Federal Government may neither issue directives requiring the States
to address particular problems, nor command the States' officers, or those of
their political subdivisions, to administer or enforce a federal regulatory
program."
5.That the anticommandeering principles recognized
by the United States Supreme Court in Printz v. United States are
predicated on the advice of James Madison, who in Federalist Number 46 advised
"a refusal to cooperate with officers of the Union" in response to
either unconstitutional federal measures or constitutional but unpopular
federal measures.
