(TEXT OF BILL BEGINS ON NEXT PAGE)





To the Congress of the United States of America:
Your memorialist respectfully
represents:
Whereas, the United States Customs
and Border Protection (CBP) is one of the world's largest law enforcement
organizations and is charged with keeping terrorists and their weapons out of
the United States while facilitating lawful international travel and trade; and
Whereas, as the world's first
full-service border entity, CBP takes a comprehensive approach to border
management and control, combining customs, immigration, border security and
agricultural protection into one coordinated and supportive activity; and
Whereas, the need to increase the
number of CBP personnel in the Tucson sector along the border between the
United States and Mexico is critical to increasing border safety and security
as well as to ensuring economic stability in our border communities; and
Whereas, increasing the number of
CBP personnel who work at the ports of entry in Arizona will enhance the
economic stability in our border communities and will increase border security
between the United States and Mexico; and
Whereas, an integrated approach to
securing the border and increasing economic stability along the border and in
our border communities is important to residents living along the border and in
our border communities; and
Whereas, increasing the number of
CBP personnel at the ports of entry in Arizona will allow increased commercial
traffic and will result in increased economic growth and stability for Arizona;
and
Whereas, all of the benefits of
increased economic stability in Arizona can be realized if the workload
capacity at each port of entry is increased, which would result in less
congestion and delay; and
Whereas, increasing the number of
CBP personnel at the ports of entry in Arizona should be part of the
infrastructure improvements that are occurring at the ports of entry; and
Whereas, the establishment of a
safe and secure border is a crucial component of national security.
Wherefore your
memorialist, the Senate of the State of Arizona, the House of Representatives
concurring, prays:
1.That, in order to
secure the border between the United States and Mexico, to enhance the safety
and security of people and their property in the currently unsecure regions of
the border and to increase economic growth and stability for the residents of
Arizona, the United States Congress act to increase the number of CBP personnel
at the ports of entry in Arizona.
2.That the Secretary of
State of the State of Arizona transmit a copy of this Memorial to the President
of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of
Representatives and each Member of Congress from the State of Arizona.
