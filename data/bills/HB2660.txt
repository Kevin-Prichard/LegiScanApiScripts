(TEXT OF BILL BEGINS ON NEXT PAGE)





Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Arizona:
Section1.Section 5-111, Arizona Revised
Statutes, is amended to read:
START_STATUTE5-111.Wagering percentage to permittee and state; exemptions
A.The commission shall prescribe rules governing
wagering on races under the system known as parimutuel
wagering.Wagering shall be conducted by a permittee only by parimutuel
wagering and only on the dates for which racing or dark day simulcasting has
been authorized by the commission. Wagering for a licensed racing meeting shall
be conducted by a commercial live-racing permittee only within an enclosure in
which authorized racing takes place and, in counties having a population of
less than five hundred thousand persons or at least one million five hundred
thousand persons, at those additional facilities that are owned or leased by a
permittee, that are approved by the commission and that are used by a permittee
for handling wagering as part of the parimutuel system of the commercial
liveracing permittee.In all other counties, wagering may
also be conducted at additional facilities that are owned or leased by a
commercial liveracing permittee who is licensed to conduct live racing
in those counties or who has the consent of all commercial permittees currently
licensed to conduct live racing in those counties and that are used by a
permittee for handling wagering and as part of the parimutuel system of
the commercial live-racing permittee.If the additional facilities
have not been used for authorized racing before their use for handling
wagering, a permittee shall not use the facilities for handling wagering before
receiving approval for use by the governing body of the city or town, if
located within the corporate limits, or by the board of supervisors, if located
in an unincorporated area of the county.A permittee may televise
any live or simulcast races received at the permittee's racing enclosure to the
additional facilities at the times the races are conducted or received at the
permittee's enclosure.For the purpose of section 5110,
subsection C only, a race on which wagering is permitted under this subsection
shall be deemed to also occur at the additional facility in the county in which
the additional facility is located, and shall be limited in the same manner as
actual live racing in that county.For the purpose of subsections B
and C of this section, the wagering at the additional facility shall be deemed
to occur in the county in which the additional facility is located.
B.During the period of any permit for dog racing in
any county, the state shall receive five and onehalf per cent percent of all monies handled in the parimutuel pool
operated by the permittee, to be paid daily during the racing
meeting.In all counties having a population of one million five
hundred thousand persons or more, four and threequarters per cent percent of the gross amount of monies handled in a parimutuel
pool shall be deducted from the parimutuel pool and shall be deposited
daily into a trust account for the payment of purse amounts.In
counties having a population of less than one million five hundred thousand
persons, four per cent percent of the gross amount of
monies handled in a parimutuel pool shall be deducted from the parimutuel
pool and shall be deposited daily in a trust account for the payment of purse
amounts. In addition, twentyfive per
cent percent
of any reduction in parimutuel taxes each year resulting from the
application of the hardship tax reduction credit determined pursuant to
subsection I of this section shall be deposited in the trust account for
supplementing purse amounts in an equitable manner over the racing meeting as
determined by the commission. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
subsection, the percentage paid by a permittee to the state does not apply to
monies handled in a parimutuel pool for wagering on simulcasts of outofstate
races.During a week in which a permittee conducts live racing at
the permittee's racetrack enclosure, the permittee shall deduct from monies
handled in a parimutuel pool for wagering on simulcasts of outofstate
races and deposit daily in a trust account for the payment of purse amounts the
same percentage of the parimutuel pool as is deducted for purses for
live races unless otherwise agreed by written contract.Unless
otherwise agreed by written contract, if the commission reasonably determines
that live racing will not be conducted within one calendar year at a racetrack
enclosure, the permittee shall deduct from monies handled in a parimutuel
pool for wagering on simulcasts of outofstate races and deposit
daily in a trust account to supplement purses of any dog track where live
racing is conducted within a one hundred mile radius.The
supplementing provided by this subsection shall be in the most equitable manner
possible as determined by the commission.The permittee shall
allocate the funds in the trust account and pay purse amounts at least
biweekly.The permittee, at the permittee's discretion, may pay
additional amounts to augment purses from the amounts received by the permittee
under this subsection.
C.During the period of a permit for horse, harness
or dog racing, the permittee that conducts the meeting may deduct up to and
including twentyfive per cent
percent of the total
amount handled in the regular parimutuel pools and, at the permittee's
option, may deduct up to and including thirty per cent percent of the total amount handled in the exacta, daily
double, quinella and other wagering pools involving two horses or dogs, and up
to and including thirtyfive per
cent percent of
the total amount handled in the trifecta or other wagering pools involving more
than two horses or dogs in one or more races.The amounts if
deducted shall be distributed as prescribed in subsection D of this section and
section 5111.02 for horse or harness racing permittees.For
dog racing permittees, unless otherwise agreed by written contract, the
permittee shall allocate to purses from amounts wagered on live racing
conducted in this state an amount equal to fifty per cent percent of any amounts that are deducted pursuant to this
subsection in excess of twenty per cent
percent of the total
amount handled in the regular parimutuel pools, twentyone per cent percent of the total amount handled in the
exacta, daily double, quinella and other wagering pools involving two dogs or
twentyfive per cent percent of the total amount
handled in the trifecta or other wagering pools involving more than two dogs in
one or more races.For dog racing permittees the percentages
prescribed in subsection B of this section shall be distributed to the state
and to the trust account for payment of purse amounts and the permittee shall
receive the balance.If the dog racing permittee has made capital
improvements, the distribution to the state shall be adjusted as provided in
section 5111.03.Monies deposited in the trust account for
payment of purses pursuant to this subsection shall be in addition to amounts
deposited pursuant to subsection B of this section.
D.During the period of a permit for horse or
harness racing, the state shall receive two per cent percent of the gross amount of the first one million
dollars of the daily parimutuel pools and five per cent percent of the gross amount exceeding one million dollars
of the daily parimutuel pools. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this subsection, the percentage paid by a permittee to the state does not apply
to monies handled in a parimutuel pool for wagering on simulcasts of outofstate
races.The permittee shall retain the balance of the total amounts
deducted pursuant to subsection C of this section.Of the amount
retained by the permittee, minus the amount payable to the permittee for
capital improvements pursuant to section 5111.02, breakage distributed
to the permittee pursuant to section 5111.01 and other applicable state,
county and city transaction privilege or other taxes, unless otherwise agreed
by written contract, fifty per cent
percent shall be used for
purses.Unless otherwise agreed by written contract, fifty per cent percent of the revenues received by the
permittee from simulcasting races as provided in section 5112, net of
costs of advertising, shall be utilized as a supplement to the general purse
structure.All amounts that are deducted from the parimutuel
pool for purses pursuant to this section and sections 5111.01, 5112
and 5114 and revenues that are received from simulcasting and that are
to be used as a supplement to the general purse structure pursuant to this
subsection shall be deposited daily into a trust account for the payment of
purse amounts.
E.Any county fair racing association may apply to
the commission for one racing meeting each year and the commission shall set
the number of days and the dates of the meetings.A racing meeting
conducted under this subsection shall be operated in such manner so that all
profits accrue to the county fair racing association, and the county fair
racing association may deduct from the parimutuel pool the same amount
as prescribed in subsection C of this section.All county fair
racing meetings, whether conducted by county fair racing associations under
this subsection or by an individual, corporation or association other than a
county fair racing association, are exempt from the payment to the state of the
percentage of the parimutuel pool prescribed by subsection D of this
section and are also exempt from the provisions of section 5111.01.
F.Monies from charity racing days are exempt from
the state percentage of the parimutuel pool prescribed in this section.
G.Sums held by a permittee for payment of unclaimed
parimutuel tickets are exempt from the revised Arizona unclaimed
property act, title 44, chapter 3.
H.All of the amounts received by a permittee from
the gross amount of monies handled in a parimutuel pool and all amounts
held by a permittee for payment of purses pursuant to this section and sections
5111.01, 5112 and 5114 are exempt from the provisions of
title 42, chapter 5.
I.On August 1 of each year, a horse racing permittee is eligible for a
hardship tax credit pursuant to this subsection.For purposes of
this subsection, "permittee" shall include any person who has
succeeded to the interest of a permittee and who is authorized to conduct horse racing at the facility
for which the permit was issued.The department shall determine the
amount of any hardship tax credit as follows:
1.Determine the percentage decrease in parimutuel
wagering by determining the percentage decrease in parimutuel wagering
between the base period amount and the amount of parimutuel wagering in
the previous fiscal year at the racetrack and the additional wagering
facilities operated by the permittee.The base period amount is the
highest total annual parimutuel wagering at the racetrack and all
additional wagering facilities as reported to the department for fiscal year
19891990, 19901991, 19911992, 19921993 or 19931994.
2.Determine the permittee's hardship tax credit by
multiplying the total parimutuel tax due as a result of wagering at the
racetrack and all additional wagering facilities for the previous fiscal year
before applying any hardship tax credit amount by the percentage decrease in
parimutuel wagering determined pursuant to paragraph 1 of this
subsection and multiplying the result by three.
3.The permittee's parimutuel tax due as
otherwise determined under subsections B and D of this section shall be reduced
for the current period and any future periods by an amount equal to the amount
of the hardship tax credit determined pursuant to this
subsection.The hardship tax credit is in addition to any other tax
exemptions, rebates and credits. END_STATUTE
