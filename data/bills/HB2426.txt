following applies:

between the victim and the defendant is one of marriage or former marriage or
of persons residing or having resided in the same household.
2.The victim and the
defendant have a child in common.
3.The victim or the
defendant is pregnant by the other party.
4.The victim is related
to the defendant or the defendant's spouse by blood or court order as a parent,

stepgrandchild, brotherinlaw or sisterinlaw.
5.The victim is a child
who resides or has resided in the same household as the defendant and is
related by blood to a former spouse of the defendant or to a person who resides
or who has resided in the same household as the defendant.
6.The relationship between
the victim and the defendant is currently or was previously a romantic or
sexual relationship. The following factors may be considered in determining
whether the relationship between the victim and the defendant is currently or
was previously a romantic or sexual relationship:
(a)The type of
relationship.
(b)The length of the
relationship.
(c)The frequency of the
interaction between the victim and the defendant.
(d)If the relationship
has terminated, the length of time since the termination.
B.A peace officer, with
or without a warrant, may arrest a person if the officer has probable cause to
believe that domestic violence has been committed and the officer has probable
cause to believe that the person to be arrested has committed the offense,
whether the offense is a felony or a misdemeanor and whether the offense was
committed within or without the presence of the peace officer.In
cases of domestic violence involving the infliction of physical injury or
involving the discharge, use or threatening exhibition of a deadly weapon or
dangerous instrument, the peace officer shall arrest a person who is at least
fifteen years of age, with or without a warrant, if the officer has probable
cause to believe that the offense has been committed and the officer has
probable cause to believe that the person to be arrested has committed the
offense, whether the offense was committed within or without the presence of
the peace officer, unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe that
the circumstances at the time are such that the victim will be protected from
further injury.Failure to make an arrest does not give rise to
civil liability except pursuant to section 12820.02.In order
to arrest both parties, the peace officer shall have probable cause to believe
that both parties independently have committed an act of domestic
violence.An act of selfdefense that is justified under

the premises.On learning or observing that a firearm is present on
the premises, the peace officer may temporarily seize the firearm if the
firearm is in plain view or was found pursuant to a consent to search and if
the officer reasonably believes that the firearm would expose the victim or
another person in the household to a risk of serious bodily injury or
death.A firearm that is owned or possessed by the victim shall not
be seized unless there is probable cause to believe that both parties
independently have committed an act of domestic violence.
D.If a firearm is seized
pursuant to subsection C of this section, the peace officer shall give the
owner or possessor of the firearm a receipt for each seized
firearm.The receipt shall indicate the identification or serial
number or other identifying characteristic of each seized firearm. Each seized
firearm shall be held for at least seventytwo hours by the law
enforcement agency that seized the firearm.
E.If a firearm is seized
pursuant to subsection C of this section, the victim shall be notified by a
peace officer before the firearm is released from temporary custody.
F.If there is reasonable
cause to believe that returning a firearm to the owner or possessor may
endanger the victim, the person who reported the assault or threat or another
person in the household, the prosecutor shall file a notice of intent to retain
the firearm in the appropriate superior, justice or municipal
court.The prosecutor shall serve notice on the owner or possessor
of the firearm by certified mail.The notice shall state that the
firearm will be retained for not more than six months following the date of
seizure.On receipt of the notice, the owner or possessor may
request a hearing for the return of the firearm, to dispute the grounds for seizure
or to request an earlier return date.The court shall hold the
hearing within ten days after receiving the owner's or possessor's request for
a hearing. At the hearing, unless the court determines that the return of the
firearm may endanger the victim, the person who reported the assault or threat
or another person in the household, the court shall order the return of the
firearm to the owner or possessor.
G.A peace officer is not
liable for any act or omission in the good faith exercise of the officer's
duties under subsections C, D, E and F of this section.
H.Each indictment,
information, complaint, summons or warrant that is issued and that involves
domestic violence shall state that the offense involved domestic violence and
shall be designated by the letters DV.A domestic violence charge
shall not be dismissed or a domestic violence conviction shall not be set aside
for failure to comply with this subsection.
I.A person who is
arrested pursuant to subsection B of this section may be released from custody
in accordance with the Arizona rules of criminal procedure or any other
applicable statute.Any order for release, with or without an
appearance bond, shall include pretrial release conditions that are necessary
to provide for the protection of the alleged victim and other specifically
designated persons and may provide for additional conditions that the court
deems appropriate, including participation in any counseling programs available
to the defendant.
J.When a peace officer
responds to a call alleging that domestic violence has been or may be
committed, the officer shall inform in writing any alleged or potential victim
of the procedures and resources available for the protection of the victim
including:
1.An order of protection
pursuant to section 133602, an injunction pursuant to section 25315
and an injunction against harassment pursuant to section 121809.
2.The emergency telephone
number for the local police agency.
3.Telephone numbers for
emergency services in the local community.
4.Websites for local
resources related to domestic violence.
K.A peace officer is not
civilly liable for noncompliance with subsection J of this section.
L.If a person is
convicted of an offense involving domestic violence and the victim was pregnant
at the time of the commission of the offense, at the time of sentencing the
court shall take into consideration the fact that the victim was pregnant and
may increase the sentence.
M.An offense that is
included in domestic violence carries the classification prescribed in the
section of this title in which the offense is classified.If the
defendant committed a felony offense listed in subsection A of this section
against a pregnant victim and knew that the victim was pregnant or if the
defendant committed a felony offense causing physical injury to a pregnant
victim and knew that the victim was pregnant, the maximum sentence otherwise
authorized for that violation shall be increased by up to two years.
N.When a peace officer responds to a call alleging
that domestic violence has been or may be committed, the officer shall
determine if a minor is present. If a minor is present, the peace officer
shall conduct a child welfare check to determine if the child is safe and if
the child might be a victim of domestic violence or child abuse. END_STATUTE
Sec.4.Section 20-448, Arizona Revised
Statutes, is amended to read:
START_STATUTE20-448.Unfair discrimination; definitions
A.A person shall not make or permit any unfair
discrimination between individuals of the same class and equal expectation of
life in the rates charged for any contract of life insurance or of life annuity
or in the dividends or other benefits payable or in any other of the terms and
conditions of the contract.
B.A person shall not make or permit any unfair
discrimination respecting hemophiliacs or between individuals of the same class
and of essentially the same hazard in the amount of premium, policy fees or
rates charged for any policy or contract of disability insurance or in the
benefits payable or in any of the terms or conditions of the contract, or in
any other manner whatever.The provisions of this subsection regarding
hemophiliacs do not apply to any policy or subscription contract which that
provides only benefits for specific diseases or for accidental
injuries or which that provides only indemnity
for blood transfusion services or replacement of whole blood products, fractions
or derivatives.
C.As to kinds of insurance other than life and
disability, a person shall not make or permit any unfair discrimination in
favor of particular persons or between insureds or subjects of insurance having
substantially like insuring, risk and exposure factors, or expense elements, in
the terms or conditions of any insurance contract, or in the rate or amount of
premium charged.
D.An insurer shall not refuse to consider an
application for life or disability insurance on the basis of a genetic
condition, developmental delay or developmental disability.
E.The rejection of an application or the
determining of rates, terms or conditions of a life or disability insurance
contract on the basis of a genetic condition, developmental delay or
developmental disability constitutes unfair discrimination, unless the
applicant's medical condition and history and either claims experience or
actuarial projections establish that substantial differences in claims are
likely to result from the genetic condition, developmental delay or
developmental disability.
F.In addition to the provisions in subsection E of
this section, the rejection of an application or the determination of rates,
terms or conditions of a disability insurance contract on the basis of a
genetic condition constitutes unfair discrimination in the absence of a
diagnosis of the condition related to information obtained as a result of a
genetic test.
G.An insurer that offers life, disability, property
or liability insurance contracts shall not deny a claim incurred or deny,
refuse, refuse to renew, restrict, cancel, exclude or limit coverage or charge
a different rate for the same coverage solely on the basis that the insured or
proposed insured is or has been a victim of domestic violence or is an entity
or individual that provides counseling, shelter, protection or other services
to victims of domestic violence.If an insurer that offers life,
disability, property or liability insurance contracts denies a claim incurred or
denies, refuses, refuses to renew, restricts, cancels, excludes or limits
coverage or charges a different rate for the same coverage on the basis of a
mental or physical condition and the insured or the proposed insured is or has
been a victim of domestic violence, the insurer shall submit a written
explanation to the insured or proposed insured of the reasons for the insurer's
actions, in accordance with section 202110.The fact that an
insured or proposed insured is or has been the victim of domestic violence is not
a mental or physical condition.Nothing contained in This subsection is not intended to provide any
private right or cause of action to or on behalf of any applicant or
insured.It is the specific intent of this subsection to provide
solely an administrative remedy to the director for any violation of this
section. Nothing in this subsection prevents an insurer from refusing to issue
a life insurance policy insuring a person who has been the victim of domestic
violence if either of the following is true:
1.The family or household member who commits the
act of domestic violence is the applicant for or prospective owner of the
policy or would be the beneficiary of the policy and any of the following is
true:
(a)The applicant or prospective beneficiary of the
policy is known, on the basis of police or court records, to have committed an
act of domestic violence.
(b)The insurer has knowledge of an arrest or
conviction for a domestic violence related offense by the family or household
member.
(c)The insurance company has other reasonable
grounds to believe, and those grounds are corroborated, that the applicant or
proposed beneficiary of a policy is a family or household member committing
acts of domestic violence.
2.The applicant or prospective owner of the policy
lacks an insurable interest in the insured.
H.Nothing in subsection G of this section prevents
an insurer that:
1.Offers life or disability insurance contracts
from underwriting coverage on the basis of an insured's or proposed insured's
mental or physical condition if the underwriting:
(a)Does not consider whether or not the mental or
physical condition was caused by an act of domestic violence.
(b)Is the same for an insured or proposed insured
who is not the victim of domestic violence as it is for an insured or proposed
insured who is the victim of domestic violence.
(c)Does not violate any other rule or law.
2.Offers property or liability insurance contracts
from underwriting coverage on the basis of the insured's claims history or
characteristics of the insured's property and using rating criteria consistent
with section 20384.
I.Any determination made pursuant to section 202537
by the external independent review organization shall not be considered in
connection with the evaluation of whether any person subject to this article
has complied with this section.
J.A property or liability insurer may exclude
coverage for losses caused by an insured's intentional or fraudulent act. The
exclusion shall not deny an insured's otherwise covered property loss if the
property loss is caused by an act of domestic violence by another insured under
the policy and the insured who claims the property loss cooperates in any
investigation relating to the loss and did not cooperate in or contribute to
the creation of the property loss. The insurer may apply reasonable standards
of proof for claims filed under this subsection. The insurer may limit the
payment to the insured's insurable interest in the property minus any payment
made to any mortgagee or other party with a secured interest in the
property.This subsection does not require an insurer to pay any
amount that is more than the amount of the loss or property coverage limits.
An insurer who pays a claim under this subsection has the right of subrogation
against any person except the victim of the domestic violence.
K.All insurers shall adopt and adhere to written
policies that are consistent with chapter 11 of this title and that specify the
procedures to be followed by employees, contractors, producers, agents and
brokers to ensure the privacy of and to help protect the safety of a victim of
domestic violence when taking an application, investigating a claim, pursuing
subrogation or taking any other action relating to a policy or claim involving
a victim of domestic violence. Insurers shall distribute the written policies
to employees, contractors, producers, agents and brokers who have access to
personal or privileged information regarding domestic violence.
L.For the purposes of this section:

at least one and onehalf standard deviations from the norm.

meaning prescribed in section 36551.
