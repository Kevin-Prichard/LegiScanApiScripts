Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Arizona:
Section1.Section 48-272, Arizona Revised
Statutes, is amended to read:
START_STATUTE48-272.Special district boundary requirements; parcel splits
prohibited; boundary modifications; consolidation
A.A
special taxing district that is organized
pursuant to this title and
that is submitting proposed district boundaries after November 1, 2007 shall
include only entire parcels of real property within its proposed boundaries as
determined by the county assessor and shall not split parcels.
B.For any
special taxing district that is organized pursuant to this title and whose
boundaries split parcels as determined by the county assessor on or before
November 1, 2007, a property owner in the district may request in writing that
the county assessor modify the special taxing district boundary so that the entire
parcel is contained within the special taxing district that governs the
majority of the area of the parcel. For parcels in which two or more special
taxing districts govern an identical percentage of the area of the parcel, the
property owner may designate the special taxing district that will govern the
entire parcel.
C.On
discovery that a parcel is split by a special taxing district boundary, the
county assessor may initiate the consolidation of the entire parcel into a
single special taxing district. The county ASSESSOR shall provide the property
owner with at least thirty days' notice of the proposed consolidation before
the proposed consolidation becomes final, and the property owner may accept or
reject that consolidation. If the property owner rejects the proposed
consolidation, the parcel shall not be consolidated into the special taxing
district. END_STATUTE
