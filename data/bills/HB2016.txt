jurisdiction the elector is registered to vote, for an official early ballot.
In addition to name and address, the requesting elector shall provide the date
of birth and state or country of birth or other information that if compared to
the voter registration information on file would confirm the identity of the
elector. If the request indicates that the elector needs a primary election
ballot and a general election ballot, the county recorder or other officer in
charge of elections shall honor the request. For any partisan primary
election, if the elector is not registered as a member of a political party that
is entitled to continued representation on the ballot pursuant to section 16804,
the elector shall designate the ballot of only one of the political parties
that is entitled to continued representation on the ballot and the elector may
receive and vote the ballot of only that one political party.The
county recorder may establish onsite early voting locations at the
recorder's office, which shall be open and available for use beginning the same
day that a county begins to send out the early ballots. The county recorder
may also establish any other early voting locations in the county the recorder
deems necessary.
B.Notwithstanding subsection A of this section, a
request for an official early ballot from an absent uniformed services voter or
overseas voter as defined in the uniformed and overseas citizens absentee

information is protected pursuant to section 16153, the county recorder
or other officer in charge of elections shall provide to the requesting voter
early ballot materials through the next regularly scheduled general election
for federal office immediately following receipt of the request unless a
different period of time, which does not exceed the next two regularly
scheduled general elections for federal office, is designated by the voter.
C.The county recorder or other officer in charge of
elections shall mail the early ballot and the envelope for its return postage
prepaid to the address provided by the requesting elector within five days

p.m. on the eleventh day preceding the election. An elector who appears
personally no later than 5:00 p.m. on the Friday preceding the election at an
onsite early voting location that is established by the county recorder
or other officer in charge of elections shall be given a ballot and permitted
to vote at the onsite location. If an elector's request to receive an
early ballot is not complete and correct but complies with all other
requirements of this section, the county recorder or other officer in charge of
elections shall attempt to notify the elector of the deficiency of the request.
F.Unless an elector specifies that the address to
which an early ballot is to be sent is a temporary address, the recorder may

of up to three times the cost of the production and distribution of the
request.
