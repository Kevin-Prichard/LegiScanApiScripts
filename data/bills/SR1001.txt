(TEXT OF BILL BEGINS ON NEXT PAGE)





Whereas, February 12, 2016 is the 207th anniversary of the
birth of Charles Darwin; and
Whereas, Charles Darwin is recognized for the discovery of
natural selection as the mechanism by which biological evolution occurs; and
Whereas, Darwin's discovery of natural selection continues to
serve as the foundation for ongoing advances in science, health, philosophy,
art, education and many other areas of modern life; and
Whereas, Darwin's strength of character is evident in the great
courage, wisdom and honesty required to explore and publish the findings
supporting natural selection as the mechanism by which biological evolution
occurs; and
Whereas, there is a consensus among the scientific community
that Darwin made multigenerational, worldclass contributions to modern
thought and that he belongs among the most influential scientific minds in
history, including Albert Einstein and Sir Isaac Newton; and
Whereas, the anniversary of Darwin's birth is an appropriate
day to celebrate and to reflect and act on the principles of intellectual
bravery and perpetual curiosity and the hunger for truth that contribute to the
wellbeing of all people; and
Whereas, the State of Arizona is rightfully proud of its
commitment to growth in the biotechnology industry, scientific research and
education, natural resource-based recreation and tourism, research hospitals,
aeronautics and other areas made possible by ongoing innovation in the life
sciences.
Therefore
Be it resolved by the Senate of the
State of Arizona:
That the Members of the Senate proclaim February 12, 2016 as
International Darwin Day in Arizona.
