Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Arizona:
Section1.Section 33-1243, Arizona Revised
Statutes, is amended to read:
START_STATUTE33-1243.Board of directors and officers; conflict; powers;
limitations; removal; annual audit; applicability
A.Except as provided in the declaration, the
bylaws, subsection B of this section or other provisions of this chapter, the
board of directors may act in all instances on behalf of the association.
B.The board of directors shall not act on behalf of
the association to amend the declaration, terminate the condominium, elect members
of the board of directors or determine the qualifications, powers and duties or
terms of office of board of directors members. Except as provided in subsection H of this section, the
board of directors may fill vacancies in its membership for the unexpired
portion of any term.
C.If any contract, decision or other action for
compensation taken by or on behalf of the board of directors would benefit any
member of the board of directors or any person who is a parent, grandparent,
spouse, child or sibling of a member of the board of directors or a parent or
spouse of any of those persons, that member of the board of directors shall
declare a conflict of interest for that issue. The member shall declare the
conflict in an open meeting of the board before the board discusses or takes
action on that issue and that member may then vote on that issue. Any contract
entered into in violation of this subsection is void and unenforceable.
D.Except as provided in the declaration, within
thirty days after adoption of any proposed budget for the condominium, the
board of directors shall provide a summary of the budget to all the unit
owners. Unless the board of directors is expressly authorized in the
declaration to adopt and amend budgets from time to time, any budget or
amendment shall be ratified by the unit owners in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this subsection.If ratification is
required, the board of directors shall set a date for a meeting of the unit
owners to consider ratification of the budget not fewer than fourteen nor more
than thirty days after mailing of the summary. Unless at that meeting a
majority of all the unit owners or any larger vote specified in the declaration
rejects the budget, the budget is ratified, whether or not a quorum is
present. If the proposed budget is rejected, the periodic budget last ratified
by the unit owners shall be continued until such time as the unit owners ratify
a subsequent budget proposed by the board of directors.
E.The declaration may provide for a period of
declarant control of the association, during which period a declarant or
persons designated by the declarant may appoint and remove the officers and
members of the board of directors.Regardless of the period provided
in the declaration, a period of declarant control terminates no later than the
earlier of:
1.Ninety days after conveyance of seventyfive
percent of the units that may be created to unit owners other than a declarant.
2.Four years after all declarants have ceased to
offer units for sale in the ordinary course of business.
F.A declarant may voluntarily surrender the right
to appoint and remove officers and members of the board of directors before
termination of the period prescribed in subsection E of this section, but in
that event the declarant may require, for the duration of the period of
declarant control, that specified actions of the association or board of
directors, as described in a recorded instrument executed by the declarant, be
approved by the declarant before they become effective.
G.Not later than the termination of any period of
declarant control the unit owners shall elect a board of directors of at least
three members, at least a majority of whom must be unit owners. The board of
directors shall elect the officers. The board members and officers shall take
office on election.
