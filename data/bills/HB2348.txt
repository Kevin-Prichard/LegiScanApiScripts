Section1.Section 28-4451, Arizona Revised
Statutes, is amended to read:
START_STATUTE28-4451.Product liability; warranty obligations; audits; vehicle
exports; definition
A.Each manufacturer shall file with the director a
copy of the delivery and preparation obligations required to be performed by a new motor vehicle dealer before
delivery of new motor vehicles to buyers.These delivery and
preparation obligations constitute the new
motor vehicle dealer's only responsibility for the product
liability as between the new motor
vehicle dealers and the manufacturer. the new motor vehicle dealer shall furnish the buyer of a
new motor vehicle with a signed copy of the manufacturer's or distributor's
delivery and preparation requirements indicating that all of the requirements
have in fact been performed.
B.Any mechanical, body or parts defects arising
from any express or implied warranties of the manufacturer constitute the
manufacturer's product or warranty liability.
C.The manufacturer or distributor shall reasonably compensate an authorized new motor vehicle dealer who
performs work to rectify the manufacturer's or distributor's product defect or warranty defects
obligations, including any recall obligations or delivery and
preparation obligations.
D.The dealer
shall furnish the purchaser of a new vehicle with a signed copy of the
manufacturer's delivery and preparation requirements indicating that all of the
requirements have in fact been performed.
E.The
manufacturer shall pay the cost of the manufacturer's delivery, warranty and
preparation requirements.
D.The
compensation that the manufacturer or distributor pays to a new motor vehicle
dealer for diagnostic work, repair service and labor shall be fair and
reasonable as determined pursuant to subsection E of this section. Time
allowances for the diagnosis and performance of warranty work and service shall
be reasonable and adequate for the work or services to be performed. The
compensation that the manufacturer or distributor pays to the new motor vehicle
dealer for parts used in warranty or recall related service shall be fair and
reasonable as determined pursuant to subsection F of this section.
E.The new
motor vehicle dealer shall establish the retail rate that it customarily
charges for labor by submitting to the manufacturer or distributor all
nonwarranty customer paid service repair orders covering repairs made during
the month before the submission and dividing the amount of the dealer's total
labor sales by the number of total labor hours that generated those sales. The
resulting average labor rate is presumed to be fair and reasonable except that
a manufacturer or distributor, within thirty days after submission, may rebut
the presumption by reasonably substantiating that the rate is unfair and
unreasonable compared to the practices of all other franchised new motor
vehicle dealers in the vicinity that offer the same line-make vehicles. The
average labor rate shall go into effect thirty days following the declaration,
subject to the right of the manufacturer or distributor to rebut the declared
rate. If the declared rate is rebutted, the manufacturer or distributor shall
propose an adjustment of the average labor rate based on the rebuttal within
thirty days after submission. If the new motor vehicle dealer does not agree
with the proposed average labor rate, the dealer may file a protest with the
director within thirty days after receipt of the manufacturer's or
distributor's proposal. If a protest is timely filed, the director shall
inform the manufacturer or distributor that a timely protest has been filed and
that a hearing will be held on the protest. In a hearing held pursuant to this
subsection, the manufacturer or distributor has the burden of proving that the
rate declared by the dealer was unfair and unreasonable and that the proposed
adjustment of the average labor rate is fair and reasonable.
F.The new
motor vehicle dealer shall establish the retail rate that it customarily
charges for warranty parts by submitting to the manufacturer or distributor one
hundred sequential nonwarranty customer paid service repair orders that contain
warranty-like parts or sixty consecutive days of nonwarranty customer-paid
service repair orders that contain warranty-like parts, whichever is less,
covering repairs made within one hundred eighty days before the submission and
setting forth the average percentage markup. The average of the markup rates
is presumed to be fair and reasonable, except that a manufacturer or
distributor, within thirty days after submission, may rebut that presumption by
reasonably substantiating that the rate is unfair and unreasonable compared to
the practices of all other franchised motor vehicle dealers in the vicinity
offering the same line-make vehicles. The retail rate shall go into effect
thirty days after the declaration, subject to the right of the manufacturer or
distributor to rebut the declared rate. If the declared rate is rebutted, the
manufacturer or distributor shall propose an adjustment of the average
percentage markup based on that rebuttal within thirty days after submission.
If the dealer does not agree with the proposed average percentage markup, the
dealer may file a protest with the director within thirty days after receipt of
the manufacturer's or distributor's proposal. If a protest is timely filed,
the director shall inform the manufacturer or distributor that a timely protest
has been filed and that a hearing will be held on the protest. In a hearing
held pursuant to this subsection, the manufacturer or distributor has the
burden of proving that the rate declared by the dealer was unfair and
unreasonable and that the proposed adjustment of the average percentage markup
is fair and reasonable.
G.In

labor, the following work may not be included in the calculation:
1.Repairs
for manufacturer or distributor special events, specials or promotional
discounts for retail customer repairs.
2.Parts

reconditioning.
F.H.The
manufacturer, factory branch, distributor or distributor branch may reasonably
and periodically audit a new motor vehicle dealer to determine the validity of
paid claims for dealer compensation or any chargebacks for warranty
parts or service compensation.Audits shall only be for the six
month period immediately following the date of the payment.This
limitation does not apply if the manufacturer reasonably suspects fraud or distributor has reasonable cause to believe that a claim
that is submitted by a new motor vehicle dealer is intentionally false or
fraudulent. As a result
of an audit that is authorized by this subsection, the manufacturer or
distributor has the right to charge back to the new motor vehicle dealer the amount
of any previously paid claim after the new motor vehicle dealer has had notice
and an opportunity to participate in all franchisor internal appellate
processes and all legal processes. 
G.I.The
manufacturer, factory branch, distributor or distributor branch shall reserve
the right to reasonable periodic audits to determine the validity of paid
claims for dealer compensation or any chargebacks for consumer or dealer
incentives.Audits shall only be for a one year period immediately
following the date of the payment.This limitation does not apply if
the manufacturer reasonably suspects
fraud.MANUFACTURER
OR DISTRIBUTOR HAS REASONABLE CAUSE TO BELIEVE THAT A CLAIM SUBMITTED BY A NEW
MOTOR VEHICLE DEALER IS INTENTIONALLY FALSE OR FRAUDULENT. AS A RESULT OF AN
AUDIT AUTHORIZED BY THIS SUBSECTION, THE MANUFACTURER OR DISTRIBUTOR HAS THE
RIGHT TO CHARGE BACK TO THE NEW MOTOR VEHICLE DEALER THE AMOUNT OF ANY
PREVIOUSLY PAID CLAIM AFTER THE NEW MOTOR VEHICLE DEALER HAS HAD NOTICE AND AN
OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN ALL FRANCHISOR INTERNAL APPELLATE PROCESSES and
ALL LEGAL PROCESSES.
J. ALL
CLAIMS BY DEALERS UNDER THIS SECTION FOR LABOR AND PARTS AND ALL CLAIMS FOR
COMPENSATION RELATIVE TO ANY SALES INCENTIVE PROGRAMS SHALL BE PAID within
THIRTY DAYS AFTER APPROVAL BY THE MANUFACTURER OR DISTRIBUTOR SUBJECT TO the
MANUFACTURER'S OR DISTRIBUTOR'S RIGHT TO AUDIT the CLAIMS PROVIDED IN
SUBSECTION H OR I of this section. ALL CLAIMS SHALL BE EITHER APPROVED OR
DISAPPROVED within THIRTY DAYS AFTER RECEIPT ON FORMS AND IN THE MANNER
SPECIFIED BY THE MANUFACTURER OR DISTRIBUTOR.Any claim not
disapproved in writing or by means of electronic transmission within thirty
days after receipt are deemed approved and payment must be made within thirty days
after approval.
K.IF A
MANUFACTURER OR DISTRIBUTOR FURNISHES A PART OR COMPONENT TO A new motor
vehicle DEALER, AT NO COST, TO USE IN PERFORMING REPAIRS UNDER A RECALL,
CAMPAIGN SERVICE ACTION OR WARRANTY REPAIR, THE MANUFACTuRER OR DISTRIBUTOR
SHALL COMPENSATE THE DEALER FOR THE PART OR COMPONENT IN THE SAME MANNER AS
WARRANTY PARTS COMPENSATION UNDER THIS SECTION BY COMPENSATING THE DEALER THE
AVERAGE MARKUP ON THE COST FOR THE PART OR COMPONENT AS LISTED IN THE
MANUFACTURERS OR DISTRIBUTOR'S PRICE SCHEDULE LESS THE COST FOR THE PART OR
COMPONENT.
L.A
MANUFACTURER OR DISTRIBUTOR MAY NOT REQUIRE A new motor vehicle DEALER TO
ESTABLISH THE RETAIL RATE CUSTOMARILY CHARGED BY THE DEALER FOR PARTS AND LABOR
BY AN UNDULY BURDENSOME OR TIME CONSUMING METHOD OR BY REQUIRING INFORMATION
THAT IS UNDULY BURDENSOME OR TIME CONSUMING TO PROVIDE calculations, INCLUDING
PART-BY-PART OR TRANSACTION-BY-TRANSACTION CALCULATIONS. A DEALER MAY NOT
DECLARE AN AVERAGE PERCENTAGE MARKUP OR AN AVERAGE LABOR RATE MORE THAN TWICE
IN ONE CALENDAR YEAR.
M.A
MANUFACTURER OR DISTRIBUTOR MAY NOT DENY A CLAIM BY A NEW MOTOR VEHICLE DEALER
FOR REIMBURSEMENT OF ANY WARRANTY PARTS OR SERVICE COMPENSATION OR ANY CONSUMER
OR DEALER INCENTIVE COMPENSATION BASED SOLELY ON A NEW MOTOR VEHICLE DEALER'S
INCIDENTAL FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH A SPECIFIC CLAIM PROCESSING REQUIREMENT, SUCH
AS A CLERICAL ERROR OR MISSING SIGNATURES, THAT DOES NOT PUT INTO QUESTION THE
LEGITIMACY OF THE CLAIM. IF A CLAIM IS REJECTED FOR A CLERICAL ERROR OR
MISSING SIGNATURES, THE NEW MOTOR VEHICLE DEALER MAY RESUBMIT A CORRECTED CLAIM
IN A TIMELY MANNER. A NEW MOTOR VEHICLE DEALER may CORRECT OR COMPLETE AND
RESUBMIT A PREVIOUSLY SUBMITTED WARRANTY OR INCENTIVE CLAIM AT ANY TIME,
INCLUDING after THE MANUFACTURER'S OR DISTRIBUTOR'S COMMENCEMENT OF AN AUDIT
AUTHORIZED BY SUBSECTION H OR I of this section OR THE MANUFACTURER'S OR
DISTRIBUTOR'S REJECTION OF THE CLAIM.
H.N.If a new motor vehicle dealer sells
or leases a vehicle to a customer who exports the vehicle to a foreign country,
unless the manufacturer, distributor or
importer proves that the new
motor vehicle dealer knew or reasonably should have known that
the vehicle would be exported, a manufacturer shall not do any of the
following:
1.Refuse to sell, allocate or deliver new motor
vehicles to the new motor vehicle dealer.
2.Charge back to or withhold payments or other
things of value from the new motor
vehicle dealer that the new

program.
4.Take an adverse action against a new motor vehicle dealer, including reducing
vehicle allocations or terminating or threatening to terminate a dealer.

is a rebuttable presumption that the new
motor vehicle dealer described in subsection H
N of this section did
not know or should not have reasonably known that the vehicle described in
subsection H N of this section would be
exported. The presumption may be rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence
