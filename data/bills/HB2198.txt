(TEXT OF BILL BEGINS ON NEXT PAGE)





Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Arizona:
Section1.Section 48-803, Arizona Revised
Statutes, is amended to read:
START_STATUTE48-803.District administered by a district board; report
A.In a district that the board of supervisors
estimates has a population of fewer than four thousand inhabitants, the
district board may consist of three or five members.In a district
that the board of supervisors estimates has a population of four thousand or
more inhabitants, the district board shall consist of five members, and for a
noncontiguous county island fire district formed pursuant to section 48851,
the board shall consist of five members.The estimate of population
by the board of supervisors is conclusive and shall be based on available
census information, school attendance statistics, election or voter
registration statistics, estimates provided by state agencies or the county
assessor, or other information as deemed appropriate by the board of
supervisors. If the board of supervisors determines, at any time prior to one
hundred twenty days before the next regular scheduled election for members of a
district board, that the population of a fire district administered by a
district board consisting of three members exceeds four thousand inhabitants,
estimated as provided in this section, the board of supervisors shall order an
increase in the number of members of the district board.If the
board of supervisors determines at any time prior to one hundred eighty days
before the next regularly scheduled election for members of a district board
that the population of a fire district administered by a district board that
consists of five members exceeds fifty thousand inhabitants as prescribed in
this section, the board of supervisors shall inform the district board that it
may expand to seven members. Any expansion to seven members shall occur by
majority vote of the district board.The increase is effective for
the election of the additional members at the next regular election of members
of the district board.
B.If a vacancy occurs on the district board other
than from expiration of a term, a
quorum of the remaining board members shall fill the vacancy by
appointment of an interim member and except for a district formed pursuant to
article 3 of this chapter, a quorum of the
remaining board members shall fill the vacancy within ninety days after the
date the vacancy occurs.Except for a district formed pursuant to
article 3 of this chapter, if a quorum
of the remaining district board members do not appoint an interim
member within that ninety-day period, the board of supervisors shall appoint an
interim member to the district board within sixty days after expiration of the
ninety-day period, and if the district is located in more than one county, the
board of supervisors of the county in which the majority of the assessed
valuation of the district is located shall make the appointment after the
expiration of the ninety-day period. If the entire board resigns or for any
reason cannot fulfill its duties or if
the board lacks sufficient members to constitute a quorum, the
board of supervisors shall appoint an administrator to who
shall administer the district with the same duties and
obligations of the elected board and
who shall serve until the board members take office after the next general
election or until a special election is called to fill vacancies on the fire
district board of directors.If the board of
supervisors fails to appoint an administrator within thirty days after the
resignation of the entire board or its inability to fulfill its duties or achieve a quorum, a special
election shall be held to fill the vacancies on the fire district board.
C.Members of the district board shall serve without
compensation, but may be reimbursed for actual expenses incurred in performing
duties required by law.
D.The board of a fire district shall appoint or
hire a fire chief.
E.The district board shall elect from its members a
chairman and a clerk.Except for a district formed pursuant to
article 3 of this chapter, the election of the chairman and the clerk must
occur at the district board meeting that first occurs in the month immediately
following each general election.
F.For districts formed under article 3 of this
chapter, of the members first elected to district boards consisting of three
members, the two people receiving the first and second highest number of votes
shall be elected to fouryear terms, and the person receiving the third
highest number of votes shall be elected to a two-year term.Of the
members first elected to district boards consisting of five members, the three
people receiving the first, second and third highest number of votes shall be
elected to four-year terms, and the two people receiving the fourth and fifth
highest number of votes shall be elected to two-year terms. Thereafter, the
term of office of each district board member shall be four years from the first
day of the month next following such member's election.Of the
members elected as additional members to a five-member district board, the person
with the highest number of votes is elected to a four-year term and the person
with the second highest number of votes is elected to a twoyear
term.If a district resolves to increase the governing board to
seven members pursuant to subsection A of this section, the governing board may
appoint two additional members to serve until the next general election. After
the general election at which the two additional members are elected, the newly
elected member with the highest number of votes serves a four-year term and the
other member serves a two-year term.Thereafter, the term of office
for these two new members is four years.
G.For any fire district that is administered by a threemember
board and that levies taxes in a fiscal year in the amount of five hundred
thousand dollars or more, the district must be administered by a fivemember
board. ,
Beginning with the first general election held after the end of
the fiscal year in which the district levied the prescribed amount, the change
to a fivemember board must occur as prescribed in this
subsection.On levying the prescribed amount, the district may not
reorganize as a threemember board regardless of any subsequent change in
the district's levy. For threeperson boards with a single vacancy for
an existing board membership position and that are adding two additional
members, the three persons with the highest number of votes are elected to a
four-year term of office.For three-person boards with two vacancies
for existing board membership positions and that are adding two additional
members, the three persons with the first, second and third highest numbers of
votes are elected to four-year terms of office and the person with the fourth
highest number of votes is elected to a twoyear term of office.Thereafter,
all terms of office for members of these five-person boards of directors must
be four years.This subsection applies to any three-member board
that is expanding to a fivemember board, regardless of whether the
expansion is the result of the amount of the district's levy. This subsection
does not apply to districts formed under article 3 of this chapter.
H.Beginning with the 2014 general election and
except for a district formed pursuant to article 3 of this chapter, all persons
who are elected or appointed to a fire district board and the fire chief who is
appointed or hired by the district board shall attend professional development
training that is provided by an association of Arizona fire districts.
District board members and the fire chief shall complete at least six hours of
professional development training, with board members completing their training
within one year after the date of the certification of their election and for
the fire chief, within one year after the date of hiring. The fire district
shall reimburse board members and the fire chief for the reasonable costs of
the training.The professional development training must include
training on open meetings laws, finance and budget matters and laws relating to
fire district governance and other matters that are reasonably necessary for
the effective administration of a fire district.
I.On or before December 31 of each year, the fire
district association that has provided training required pursuant to subsection
H of this section shall submit a report that describes the compliance with lists the elected officials and fire chiefs who attended the
training requirements to
the county board of supervisors for every county in which the fire district
operates.The annual report must include at least the following:
1.A compilation of the professional development
training delivered by the association pursuant to this section and the names of
the fire district board members and fire chiefs who are compliant and noncompliant with the requirements of
attended training as required by this
section.
2.Recommendations regarding improvements to the
laws of this state or to administrative actions that are required under the
laws of this state pertaining to fire districts.
J.For fire district governing board members and
fire chiefs who are required to attend professional development training
pursuant to subsection H of this section, a fire district governing board
member or fire chief who fails to complete the professional development
training within the time prescribed in this section is guilty of nonfeasance in
office.Any person may make a formal complaint to the county board
of supervisors regarding this failure to comply, and the county board of
supervisors may submit the complaint to the county attorney for possible
action.The county attorney may take appropriate action to achieve
compliance, including filing an action in superior court against a fire
district governing board member or a fire chief for failure to comply with the
professional development training requirements prescribed in this
section.If the court determines that a fire district governing
board member or fire chief failed to comply with the professional development
training requirements prescribed in this section, the court shall issue an
order removing the fire district governing board member from office or the fire
chief from employment or appointment with the district.Any vacancy
in the office of a fire district governing board as a result of a court order
that is issued pursuant to this subsection must be filled in the manner
provided by law. END_STATUTE
