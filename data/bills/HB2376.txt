Section1.Section 13-603, Arizona Revised
Statutes, is amended to read:
START_STATUTE13-603.Authorized disposition of offenders
A.Every person convicted of any offense defined in
this title or defined outside this title shall be sentenced in accordance with
this chapter and chapters 7, 8 and 9 of this title unless otherwise provided by
law.
B.If a person is convicted of an offense, the
court, if authorized by chapter 9 of this title, may suspend the imposition or
execution of sentence and grant such person a period of probation except as
otherwise provided by law.The sentence is tentative to the extent
that it may be altered or revoked in accordance with chapter 9 of this title,
but for all other purposes it is a final judgment of conviction.
C.If a person is convicted of an offense, the court
shall require the convicted person to make restitution to the person who is the
victim of the crime or to the immediate family of the victim if the victim has
died, in the full amount of the economic loss as determined by the court and in
the manner as determined by the court or the court's designee pursuant to
chapter 8 of this title. If an amount
certain for restitution is stipulated to in a plea agreement and the plea
agreement is entered and accepted by the court, the court shall order the
stipulated restitution amount to be paid. Restitution ordered
pursuant to this subsection shall be paid to the clerk of the court for
disbursement to the victim and is a criminal penalty for the purposes of a
federal bankruptcy involving the person convicted of an offense.
D.If the court imposes probation it may also impose
a fine as authorized by chapter 8 of this title.
E.If a person is convicted of an offense and not
granted a period of probation, or when probation is revoked, any of the
following sentences may be imposed:
1.A term of imprisonment authorized by this chapter
or chapter 7 of this title.
2.A fine authorized by chapter 8 of this
title.The sentence is tentative to the extent it may be modified or
revoked in accordance with chapter 8 of this title, but for all other purposes
it is a final judgment of conviction.If the conviction is of a
class 2, 3 or 4 felony, the sentence cannot consist solely of a fine.
3.Both imprisonment and a fine.
4.Intensive probation, subject to the provisions of
chapter 9 of this title.
5.Intensive probation, subject to the provisions of
chapter 9 of this title, and a fine.
6.A new term of probation or intensive probation.
F.If an enterprise is convicted of any offense, a
fine may be imposed as authorized by chapter 8 of this title.
G.If a person or an enterprise is convicted of any
felony, the court may, in
addition to any other sentence authorized by law, may order the forfeiture, suspension or
revocation of any charter, license, permit or prior approval granted to the
person or enterprise by any department or agency of the state or of any
political subdivision.
H.A court authorized to pass sentence upon on a person convicted of any offense defined
within or without this title shall have a duty to determine and impose the
punishment prescribed for such offense.
I.If a person is convicted of a felony offense and
the court sentences the person to a term of imprisonment, the court at the time
of sentencing shall impose on the convicted person a term of community
supervision.The term of community supervision shall be served
consecutively to the actual period of imprisonment if the person signs and
agrees to abide by conditions of supervision established by the state department
of corrections.Except pursuant to subsection J of this section, the term of community
supervision imposed by the courtshall be for a period equal to one day
for every seven days of the sentence or sentences imposed.
J.In calculating the term of community supervision,
all fractions shall be decreased to the nearest month, except for a class 5 or
6 felony which shall not be less than one month.
K.Notwithstanding subsection I of this section, if the court sentences a
person to serve a consecutive term of probation immediately after the person
serves a term of imprisonment, the court may waive community supervision and
order that the person begin serving the term of probation upon on
the person's release from confinement.The court may retroactively
waive the term of community supervision or that part remaining to be served if
the community supervision was imposed before July 21, 1997.If the
court waives community supervision, the term of probation imposed shall be
equal to or greater than the term of community supervision that would have been
imposed. If the court does not waive community supervision, the person shall
begin serving the term of probation after the person serves the term of
community supervision.The state department of corrections shall
provide reasonable notice to the probation department of the scheduled release
of the inmate from confinement by the department.
L.If at the time of sentencing the court is of the
opinion that a sentence that the law requires the court to impose
isclearly excessive, the court may enter a special order allowing
the person sentenced to petition the board of executive clemency for a
commutation of sentence within ninety days after the person is committed to the
custody of the state department of corrections.If the court enters
a special order regarding commutation, the court shall set forth in writing its
specific reasons for concluding that the sentence is clearly
excessive.The court shall allow both the state and the victim to
submit a written statement on the matter.The court's order, and
reasons for its order, and the statements of the state and the victim shall be
sent to the board of executive clemency.END_STATUTE
Sec.2.Section 13-804, Arizona Revised
Statutes, is amended to read:
START_STATUTE13-804.Restitution for offense causing economic loss; fine for
reimbursement of public monies
A.On a defendant's conviction for an offense
causing economic loss to any person, the court, in its sole discretion, may
order that all or any portion of the fine imposed be allocated as restitution
to be paid by the defendant to any person who suffered an economic loss caused
by the defendant's conduct.
B.In ordering restitution for economic loss
pursuant to section 13603, subsection C or subsection A of this section,
the court shall consider all losses caused by the criminal offense or offenses
for which the defendant has been convicted. If an amount certain for restitution is stipulated to in a
plea agreement and the plea agreement is entered and accepted by the court, the
court shall order the stipulated restitution amount to be paid. 
C.The court shall not consider the economic
circumstances of the defendant in determining the amount of restitution.
D.Restitution payments that are ordered pursuant to
section 13603and this section shall not be stayed if the defendant
files a notice of appeal, and the payments may be held by the court pending the
outcome of an appeal.
E.After the court determines the amount of
restitution, the court or a staff member designated by the court, including a
probation officer, shall specify the manner in which the restitution is to be
paid.In deciding the manner in which the restitution is to be paid,
the court or a staff member designated by the court, including a probation
officer, shall make reasonable efforts to contact any victim who has requested
notice pursuant to sections 134415 and 134417, shall take into
account the views of the victim and shall consider the economic circumstances
of the defendant.In considering the economic circumstances of the
defendant, the court shall consider all of the defendant's assets and income,
including workers' compensation and social security benefits.The
court shallmake all reasonable efforts to ensure that all persons who are entitled to restitution
pursuant to a court order promptly receive full restitution.The
court may enter any reasonable order necessary to accomplish
this.If a victim has received reimbursement for the victim's
economic loss from an insurance company, a crime victim compensation program
funded pursuant to section 412407 or any other entity, the court shall
order the defendant to pay the restitution to that entity.If a
victim has received only partial reimbursement for the victim's economic loss,
the court shall order the defendant to pay restitution first to the victim and
then to the entity that partially reimbursed the victim.If a probation,
parole or community supervision officer has reason to believe that court
ordered restitution is not being made, the officer shall report to the court
supervising the probationer or the board of executive clemency that the
defendant has failed to make restitution in a timely manner and the court or
the board of executive clemency may revoke the defendant's probation, parole or
community supervision.
F.If more than one defendant is convicted of the
offense that caused the loss, the defendants are jointly and severally liable
for the restitution.
G.If the court does not have sufficient evidence to
support a finding of the amount of restitution or the manner in which the
restitution should be paid, it may conduct a hearing on the issue according to
procedures established by court rule.The court may call the
defendant to testify and to produce information or evidence.The
state does not represent persons who have suffered economic loss at the hearing
but may present evidence or information and
make an argument to the court that is relevant to the issue of
restitution.
H.After making the determinations in subsection B
of this section the trial court shall enter a restitution order for each
defendant that sets forth all of the following:
1.The total amount of restitution the defendant
owes all persons.
2.The total amount of restitution owed to each
person.
3.The manner in which the restitution is to be
paid.
I.The restitution order under subsection H of this
section may be supported by evidence or information introduced or submitted to
the court before sentencing or any evidence previously heard by the judge
during the proceedings.
J.A restitution lien shall be created in favor of
the state for the total amount of the restitution.
K.A restitution lien shall be created in favor of
the state for the total amount of the fine, surcharges, assessments, costs,
incarceration costs and fees ordered, if any, except that a lien may not be
perfected against a titled motor vehicle.
L.Notwithstanding any other law, a restitution lien
is created in favor of a victim of the defendant ordered to make
restitution.Monies received monthly from the defendant shall be
applied first to satisfy the restitution order entered by the court and the
payment of any restitution in arrears.Any monies that are owed by
this state to a person who is under a restitution order shall be assigned first
to discharge the restitution order, including any tax refund that is owed to
the defendant.
M.If the defendant, the state or persons entitled
to restitution pursuant to a court order disagree with the manner of payment
established in subsection E of this section, the defendant, court or person
entitled to restitution may petition the court at any time to change the manner
in which the restitution is paid.Before modifying the order
pertaining to the manner in which the restitution is paid, the court shall give
notice and an opportunity to be heard to the defendant, the state and, on
request, any persons
entitled to restitution pursuant to a court order.END_STATUTE
Sec.3.Section
13-4437, Arizona Revised Statutes, is amended to read:
START_STATUTE13-4437.Standing to invoke rights; recovery of damages; right to
counsel
A.The
rights enumerated in the victims' bill of rights, article II, section 2.1,
Constitution of Arizona, any implementing legislation or court rules belong to
the victim. The victim has standing to seek an order, to bring a
special action, or to
file a notice of appearance in an appellate proceeding, seeking to enforce any right or to challenge
an order denying any right guaranteed to victims under the victims' bill of rights, article II, section 2.1,

counsel at the victim's expense.

governmental entity responsible for the intentional, knowing or grossly
negligent violation of the victim's rights under the victims' bill of rights,

E.Notwithstanding
any other law and Without limiting any rights and powers of the victim, the
victim has the right to present evidence or information and to make an argument
to the court, personally or through counsel, at any proceeding to determine the
amount of restitution pursuant to section 13804.END_STATUTE
Sec.4.Legislative intent
It is the intent of the legislature to protect the rights of
crime victims, including the right to receive prompt restitution from the
person who is convicted of the criminal conduct that caused the victim's loss
or injury. The legislature finds that crime victims in this state have
constitutional rights to justice and due process, to be treated with fairness,
to restitution and to have all rules governing criminal procedure protect
victims' rights and to have these rules be subject to amendment or repeal by
the legislature to ensure the protection of these rights. The legislature has
the constitutional authority to enact substantive and procedural laws to
define, implement, preserve and protect the rights guaranteed to victims.
Sections 13-603, 13-804 and 13-4437, Arizona Revised Statutes, as amended by
this act, are amended pursuant to these rights and this constitutional grant of
authority.
