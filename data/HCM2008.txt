(TEXT OF BILL BEGINS ON NEXT PAGE)





To the Congress of the
United States of America:
Your memorialist respectfully represents:
Whereas, this state
and the Navajo Nation maintain a governmenttogovernment
relationship, and the Navajo people residing in this state are citizens of both
Arizona and the Navajo Nation; and
Whereas, in 1968, the
Navajo Nation established Navajo Community College, which later became Din
College, to provide access to higher education to the Navajo people; and
Whereas, Din
College's flagship campus is located in Tsaile, Arizona, and there are
community campuses in Tuba City, Chinle and Window Rock; and
Whereas, Din College
has dual credit agreements with school districts and schools throughout
Arizona, including Red Mesa Unified School District #27, Chinle Unified School
District #24, Ganado Unified School District, St. Michaels High School, Window
Rock Unified School District #8, Many Farms High School, Kayenta Unified School
District, Pion Unified School District #4, Greyhills Academy High School, Tuba
City High School, Leupp Schools, Inc. and Phoenix Union High School District;
and
Whereas, this state
provides support to Din College through its Navajo Nation, Din College-State
of Arizona funding compact, the tribal college dual credit funding program and
Proposition 301 monies; and
Whereas, the United
States Congress passed the Navajo Community College Act, the Navajo Community
College Assistance Act of 1978 and the Navajo Nation Higher Education Act of
2008, which collectively provide for maintenance, operation and construction
funding for Din College; and
Whereas,
Representative Ann Kirkpatrick introduced the Din College Act of 2015 "to
fulfill the United States Government's trust responsibility to serve the higher
education needs of the Navajo people and to clarify, unify, and modernize prior
Din College legislation," and Din College has requested that Senator
Jeff Flake introduce a United States Senate companion bill; and
Whereas, this state
stands in support of the passage of the Din College Act of 2015.
Wherefore your memorialist, the House of Representatives of the
State of Arizona, the Senate concurring, prays:
1.That the
Congress of the United States enact the Din College Act of 2015.
2.That the
Secretary of State of the State of Arizona transmit copies of this Memorial to
the Governor of the State of Arizona, the President of the United States Senate,
the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives and each Member of
Congress from the State of Arizona.
