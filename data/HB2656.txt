Section1.Section 33-1250, Arizona Revised
Statutes, is amended to read:
START_STATUTE33-1250.Voting; proxies; absentee ballots; cumulative voting;
applicability; definition
A.If only one of the multiple owners of a unit is
present at a meeting of the association, the owner is entitled to cast all the
votes allocated to that unit. If more than one of the multiple owners are
present, the votes allocated to that unit may be cast only in accordance with
the agreement of a majority in interest of the multiple owners unless the
declaration expressly provides otherwise. There is majority agreement if any
one of the multiple owners casts the votes allocated to that unit without
protest being made promptly to the person presiding over the meeting by any of the
other owners of the unit.
B.During the period of declarant control, votes
allocated to a unit may be cast pursuant to a proxy duly executed by a unit
owner. If a unit is owned by more than one person, each owner of the unit may
vote or register protest to the casting of votes by the other owners of the
unit through a duly executed proxy. A unit owner may not revoke a proxy given
pursuant to this section except by actual notice of revocation to the person
presiding over a meeting of the association. A proxy is void if it is not
dated or purports to be revocable without notice.The proxy is
revoked on presentation of a later dated proxy executed by the same unit
owner. A proxy terminates one year after its date, unless it specifies a shorter
term or unless it states that it is coupled with an interest and is
irrevocable.
C.Notwithstanding any provision in the condominium
documents, after termination of the period of declarant control, votes
allocated to a unit may not be cast pursuant to a proxy. The association shall
provide for votes to be cast in person and by absentee ballot and, in addition,
the association may provide for voting by some other form of delivery,
including the use of e-mail and fax delivery. Notwithstanding section 103708
or the provisions of the condominium documents, any action taken at an annual,
regular or special meeting of the members shall comply with all of the
following if absentee ballots or ballots provided by some other form of
delivery are used:
1.The ballot shall set forth each proposed action.
2.The ballot shall provide an opportunity to vote
for or against each proposed action.
3.The ballot is valid for only one specified
election or meeting of the members and expires automatically after the
completion of the election or meeting.
4.The ballot specifies the time and date by which
the ballot must be delivered to the board of directors in order to be counted,
which shall be at least seven days after the date that the board delivers the
unvoted ballot to the member.
5.The ballot does not authorize another person to
cast votes on behalf of the member.
D.Votes cast by absentee ballot or other form of
delivery, including the use of e-mail and fax delivery, are valid for the
purpose of establishing a quorum.
E.Notwithstanding subsection C of this section, an
association for a timeshare plan as defined in section 322197 may permit
votes by a proxy that is duly executed by a unit owner.
F.If the declaration requires that votes on
specified matters affecting the condominium be cast by lessees rather than unit
owners of leased units all of the following apply:
1.The provisions of subsections A and B of this
section apply to lessees as if they were unit owners.
2.Unit owners who have leased their units to other
persons shall not cast votes on those specified matters.
3.Lessees are entitled to notice of meetings,
access to records and other rights respecting those matters as if they were
unit owners. Unit owners shall also be given notice, in the manner prescribed
in section 331248, of all meetings at which lessees may be entitled to
vote.
G.Unless the declaration provides otherwise, votes
allocated to a unit owned by the association shall not be cast.
H.NOTWITHSTANDING
title 10, chapter 30 and any provision in the condominium documents, an
association may not use cumulative voting.
H.I.This section does
not apply to timeshare plans or associations that are subject to chapter 20 of
this title.
I.J.For the purposes
of this section, "period of declarant control" means the time during
which the declarant or persons designated by the declarant may elect or appoint
the members of the board of directors pursuant to the condominium documents or
by virtue of superior voting power. END_STATUTE
