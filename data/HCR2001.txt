recognizing the
Arizona Veterans Hall of Fame.


(TEXT OF BILL BEGINS ON NEXT PAGE)





Whereas, more than
600,000 military veterans who have honorably sacrificed in answering the call
to serve in our nation's defense reside in the State of Arizona; and
Whereas, the people of
the State of Arizona recognize and appreciate the contributions these military
veterans have made to our society and safety and acknowledge that these men and
women are deserving of our greatest respect and admiration; and
Whereas, many of these
military veterans continue to serve and inspire the citizens of Arizona through
the performance of significant good deeds and noble accomplishments that extend
beyond their military service; and
Whereas, these
military veterans enrich our communities through distinguished careers and
continued selfless public service to other veterans, military personnel and
their families, survivors and other citizens in need; and
Whereas, the Unified
Arizona Veterans (UAV), a consortium of Arizona veterans service organizations
operating to present a unified stand on veterans and retiree issues and
legislation across the State of Arizona, recognized that these military veteran
public servants were not receiving the recognition they deserved; and
Whereas, with the
advice and assistance of the Arizona Department of Veterans' Services, the UAV
agreed to establish a means of recognizing meritorious Arizona veterans from
all eras, all branches of service and all walks of life; and
Whereas, on January
31, 2001, the UAV received the support of Governor Jane D. Hull in the
establishment of the Arizona Veterans Hall of Fame (AVHOF) to recognize and
honor deserving individuals; and
Whereas, the AVHOF
inaugural induction ceremony was held on May 30, 2001, honoring 26 Medal of
Honor recipients, 13 of whom received this honor before Arizona statehood, and
24 other distinguished Arizona veterans; and
Whereas, since its
inception in 2001, 36 Medal of Honor recipients and 295 other praiseworthy
military veterans have been inducted into the AVHOF at annual induction
ceremonies; and
Whereas, every year
since 2001, each Arizona governor in succession has endorsed all honorees by
approving their induction into the AVHOF and by issuing a proclamation
pronouncing an annual AVHOF Day; and
Whereas, the inductees
to the AVHOF came together in 2007 to form the Arizona Veterans Hall of Fame
Society, composed of all individual AVHOF honorees with the purpose of bringing
them together to work for the continued collective good of others.
Therefore
Be it resolved by the House of Representatives of the State of
Arizona, the Senate concurring:
1.That the
Members of the Legislature recognize the members of the Arizona military
veterans community and acknowledge that they are great assets to our state.
2.That the
Members of the Legislature support the men, women and families of our nation's
military and our military veterans.
3.That the
Members of the Legislature recognize the deeds and accomplishments of those
Arizona military veterans who have continued to serve their communities in a
truly exemplary fashion after their military service and have been inducted
into the AVHOF.
4.That the
Members of the Legislature recognize the AVHOF and support its noble endeavors
to recognize these outstanding individuals.
