of the certified claims.
B.In a calendar year in which the annual growth
rate exceeds the trend growth rate, the excess growth when multiplied by total
general fund revenue of the fiscal year ending in the calendar year determines
the amount to be appropriated by the legislature to the budget stabilization
fund in the fiscal year in which the calendar year ends.
C.In a calendar year in which the annual growth
rate is both less than two per cent
percent and less than the
trend growth rate, the difference between the annual growth rate and the trend
growth rate when multiplied by the total general fund revenue of the fiscal
year ending in the calendar year determines the amount to be transferred by the
legislature from the budget stabilization fund to the state general fund at the
end of the fiscal year in which the calendar year ends.The transfer
calculated pursuant to this subsection shall not exceed the available balance
in the fund, nor shall the legislature transfer an amount which that
exceeds the amount sufficient to balance the general fund budget.
D.The legislature shall pass a bill which that
contains the emergency clause if the legislature either:

property in the county of not more than ten cents per one hundred dollars of
assessed valuation. The tax levy provided for in this subsection shall be a
levy of secondary property taxes and shall not be subject to title 42, chapter
17, article 2.The county treasurer shall pay to each fire district,
including a fire district formed pursuant to section 48851, in the
county from the proceeds of the tax an amount equal to twenty percent of the

will be levied, except that:
1.The amount of assistance from the county to a
fire district shall be reduced as follows:
(a)Through the fiscal year that ends June 30, 2012,
by the dollar amount that the fire district receives from the fire district
assistance tax that exceeds three hundred thousand dollars from and after June
30 of each fiscal year.
(b)Beginning with the fiscal year that starts July
1, 2012, by the dollar amount that the fire district receives from the fire
district assistance tax that exceeds four hundred thousand dollars from and
after June30 of each fiscal year, without regard to whether the district
is located in more than one county.
(c)Except as provided in paragraph 2 of this
subsection, if the total amount to be paid to all districts in the county under
this paragraph exceeds the amount to be raised by the levy of ten cents per one
hundred dollars assessed valuation, then the county treasurer shall pay an
amount less than twenty percent of the property tax levy of each
district.The amount to be paid by the county treasurer to each
district shall be determined by multiplying the proceeds of the county fire
district assistance tax against the proportion that twenty percent of the
property tax levy of each district bears to the total of twenty percent of the
property tax levies of all fire districts in the county.
2.For fiscal years beginning from and after July 1,
1992, the amount of assistance from the county to a fire district shall not be
less than the assistance provided from and after June 30, 1991 through June 30,

levies a tax, in addition to any tax levied under section 48806, of
three dollars per one hundred dollars of assessed valuation and the assessed
valuation is at least ninety percent of the assessed valuation for the 1991 tax
year.This paragraph does not apply to fire districts subject to
paragraph 1, subdivision (a) or (b) of this subsection.

that starts July 1, 2015, a consolidated district shall not
receive more than four hundred thousand dollars in fire district assistance tax

than one county. Beginning with the
fiscal year that starts July 1, 2016, a consolidated district may receive fire
district assistance tax monies as otherwise prescribed by this section.
D.Beginning with the fiscal year that starts July
1, 2012 and ending with the fiscal year
that starts July 1, 2015, if two or more fire districts merge to
form a consolidated district and the total of the amounts received by each fire
district from the fire district assistance tax is less than four hundred
thousand dollars, the consolidated district may continue to receive monies
until its receipts total four hundred thousand dollars, as prescribed in
subsection A of this section, without regard to whether the consolidated
district is located in more than one county. Beginning with the fiscal year that starts July 1, 2016, a
consolidated district may receive fire district assistance tax monies as
otherwise prescribed by this section without regard to whether the consolidated
district is located in more than one county.
E.The board, based on the budget submitted by the
district, shall levy, in addition to any tax levied as provided in section 48806,
a tax not to exceed three dollars twenty-five cents per one hundred dollars of
assessed valuation, or the amount of the levy in the preceding tax year
multiplied by 1.08, whichever levy is less, and minus any amounts required to
reduce the levy pursuant to subsection H of this section, against all property

an election as prescribed by subsection G of this section, may authorize the
board to levy a tax exceeding the limits prescribed by subsection E of this
section under one, but not both, of the following options:
1.The electors may authorize a permanent override
allowing annual levies without reference to the levy in the preceding tax year,
but remaining subject to the tax rate limit of three dollars twenty-five cents
per one hundred dollars of assessed valuation. An election for the purposes of
this paragraph must be held at a regularly scheduled general election held on
the first Tuesday following the first Monday in November as prescribed by
section 16204, subsection F.
2.If the net
assessed valuation of all property in the district declines by a combined total
of twenty percent or more over two consecutive valuation years,
The electors voting at the next
a regularly scheduled
general election held on the first Tuesday following the first Monday in
November as prescribed by section 16204, subsection F may authorize an
override for five consecutive tax years allowing annual levies that are exempt
from the tax rate limit of three dollars twenty-five cents, but subject to an annual levy limit of the amount of the
levy in the preceding tax year multiplied by 1.05.After
the fifth tax year, the district is again subject to the limits prescribed by
subsection E of this section, computed by multiplying the levy beginning in the
year preceding the override by 1.08 for each year through the current tax year, and shall not seek an additional override
during the five tax years immediately following the expiration of the override.
G.The call for an override election held for the
purposes of subsection F of this section must state:
1.The purpose for requesting additional secondary
property tax revenue for the district.
2.If the voters approve the levy:
(a)The maximum dollar amount of secondary property
tax that may be collected in the first year compared to the existing maximum
secondary property tax levy prescribed in subsection E of this section.
(b)The estimated secondary property tax rate to
fund the proposed levy under subdivision (a) of this paragraph in the first tax
year compared to the secondary property tax rate levied in the current year.
H.If the district annexes additional territory, the
limit under subsection E of this section shall be adjusted by applying the
district's tax rate to the assessed valuation of the annexed property in the
preceding tax year.If districts are merged or consolidated under
this chapter, the limitation under this subsection in the first year after the
districts are merged or consolidated is the total of the levies of the merged
or consolidated districts in the preceding tax year multiplied by 1.08 or the
amount of the levies allowed by the maximum rate prescribed by subsection E of
this section, whichever is less.
I.The district shall maintain any property tax
revenues collected in excess of the sum of the amounts of taxes collectible
pursuant to section 4217054 and the allowable levy determined under
subsection E of this section in a separate fund and used to reduce the property
tax levy in the following tax year.
J.The levy limit under this section is considered
to be increased each year to the maximum limit permissible under subsection E
of this section regardless of whether the district actually levies taxes up to
the maximum permissible amount in that year.
K.The county treasurer shall keep the money
received from taxes levied pursuant to subsection E of this section in a
separate fund known as the "fire district general fund" of the
district for which collected. Any surplus remaining in the fire district
general fund at the end of the fiscal year shall be credited to the fire
district general fund of the district for which it was collected for the
succeeding fiscal year and after subtraction of accounts payable and
encumbrances, shall be used to reduce the property tax levy in the following
tax year.
L.A fire district may maintain separate accounts
with a financial institution that is authorized to do business in this state
for the purpose of operating a payroll account or for holding special revenues
or ambulance revenues, or both, as necessary to fulfill the district's
fiduciary responsibilities.
M.A fire district, through the county treasurer,
shall establish the relevant governmental funds necessary for the proper
management and fiscal accountability of district monies from property taxes,
grants, contributions and donations, as defined by the government accounting
standards board. Unless the monies received are legally restricted by contract,
agreement or law, those monies may be transferred between fund accounts
according to the original or amended budget of the fire district.
N.A fire district shall reconcile all balance sheet
accounts for accounts for each calendar month of the fiscal year within thirty
days after the end of that calendar month.The fire district board
shall review the reconciled balance sheet accounts monthly, except that for a
fire district that is governed by a three-member board, the board may review
the reconciled balance sheet accounts every two months.
O.A fire district shall produce monthly financial
reports to include a register of checks, warrants and deposits, a statement of
financial activities and a statement of net assets for each calendar month. A
fire district shall produce a cash flow projection report for each fiscal
year. The cash flow projection report shall be updated monthly with the actual
revenues and expenditures from the preceding month. Each month, the fire
district board shall review the financial reports, the updated cash flow
projections report and all month-end fund statements and reports of the
preceding month to include those reports provided by the county treasurer and each
of the financial institutions in which the district maintains an account,
except that for a fire district that is governed by a threemember board,
the board may review the reports and statements prescribed by this subsection
every two months. Any financial report or cash flow projection report that
would indicate that the district is likely to violate section 48805.02,
subsectionD, paragraph 1 or that would indicate an adverse impact on the
ongoing operations or liquidity of the district shall be reported by the fire
district board chairman in writing and delivered by certified mail to the
county treasurer and the county board of supervisors within ten days after the
discovery.
P.Notwithstanding section 11605, a fire
district may register warrants only if separate accounts are maintained by the
county treasurer for each governmental fund of a fire district. Warrants may
only be registered on the maintenance and operation account, the unrestricted
capital outlay account and the special revenue account, and only if the total
cash balance of all three accounts is insufficient to pay the warrants and
after any revolving line of credit has been expended as prescribed in section
11635.
Q.When a fire district has adopted a budget and the
board of supervisors has levied a fire district tax as provided in subsection E
of this section and the district has insufficient money in its general fund
with the county treasurer to operate the district, the chairman of the board,
on or after August 1 of each year, may draw warrants for the purposes
prescribed in section 48805 on the county treasurer, payable on November
1 of that year or on April 1 of the succeeding year. The aggregate amounts of
the warrants may not exceed ninety percent of the taxes levied by the county
for the district's current fiscal year.If the treasurer cannot pay
a warrant for lack of funds in the fire district general fund, the warrant
shall be endorsed, be registered, bear interest and be redeemed as provided by
law for county warrants, except that the warrants are payable only from the
fire district general fund.
