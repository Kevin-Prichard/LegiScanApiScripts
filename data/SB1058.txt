the occupant's presence in the residence is unlawful and that the landlord is
seeking the unlawful occupant's immediate removal by court order.

delivery of written notice to the unlawful occupant pursuant to subsection A of
this section, the landlord may institute a special detainer action pursuant to
section 33-1377 that seeks the immediate removal of the unlawful occupant, the
payment of costs and the payment of any quantifiable damage to the premises
caused by the unlawful occupant.

purposes of this section, "unlawful occupant" means a person who is
all of the following:
1.Occupying
a residence without the permission of the landlord.
2.Not a
guest of a tenant of that residence.

occupants under section 33-1368.01, the court shall give judgment for the
plaintiff for restitution of the premises, for money damages for damage to the
premises and for costs.
G.If the defendant is found not guilty, judgment
shall be given for the defendant against the plaintiff for costs, and if it
appears that the plaintiff has acquired possession of the premises since
