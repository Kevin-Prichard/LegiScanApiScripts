(TEXT OF BILL BEGINS ON NEXT PAGE)





Whereas, human
trafficking is a form of oppression that severely victimizes vulnerable
populations; and
Whereas, human
trafficking occurs when a person is recruited, harbored, transported or
obtained for the purposes of commercial sex, forced labor, involuntary
servitude or debt bondage through force, fraud or coercion if the victim has
not reached eighteen years of age; and
Whereas, fewer than 2%
of human trafficking victims are ever identified; and
Whereas, the average
age of entry for youth into sex trafficking in Arizona is 14; and
Whereas, Arizona
policymakers have worked to combat human trafficking through the adoption of
new laws that prohibit human trafficking and related activities; and
Whereas, both federal
and state law criminalize human trafficking and impose strong penalties on
individuals who violate the law; and
Whereas, the nature of
human trafficking makes it difficult to identify victims; and
Whereas, the State of
Arizona is committed to raising public awareness and ensuring that there is
zero tolerance for human trafficking; and
Whereas, the State of
Arizona is committed to protecting the rights of victims and restoring their
freedom and dignity; and
Whereas, the problem
of human trafficking in Arizona persists, and more can and should be done to
combat this heinous crime; and
Whereas, coordination
between federal, state and local governments, agencies and human service
providers is critical to address the issue of human trafficking.
Therefore
Be it resolved by the House of Representatives of the State of
Arizona, the Senate concurring:
That the Members of
the Legislature proclaim January 2016 as Human Trafficking Awareness Month in
Arizona.
