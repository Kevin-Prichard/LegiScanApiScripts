project the amount of monies that the fund will collect over the next four
years and the time such monies shall become available. Whenever the commission
determines that the fund contains more monies than the commission determines
that it requires to meet current debts plus expected expenses, under the
assumption that expected expenses will be at the expenditure limit in section

collections, the commission shall designate such monies as excess monies and so
notify the state treasurer, who shall thereupon transfer the excess monies to
the state general fund.

project the amount of clean elections funding for which all candidates will
have qualified pursuant to this article for the following calendar
year.By the end of each year, the commission shall announce whether
the amount that the commission plans to spend the following year pursuant to
section 16949, subsection A exceeds the projected amount of clean
elections funding.If the commission determines that the fund
contains insufficient monies or the spending cap would be exceeded were all
candidates' accounts to be fully funded, the commission may include in the
announcement specifications for decreases in the following parameters, based on
the commission's projections of collections and expenses for the fund,
including that the fund will provide monies under section 16951 as a
fraction of the amounts there specified.
D.If the commission cannot provide participating
candidates with all monies specified under sections 16951 and 16952,
as decreased by any announcement pursuant to subsection C of this section, the
commission shall allocate any reductions in payments proportionately among
candidates entitled to monies and shall declare an emergency.Upon on declaration of an emergency, a
participating candidate may accept private contributions to bring the total
monies received by the candidate from the fund and from such private
contributions up to the adjusted spending limits, as decreased by any
announcement made pursuant to subsection C of this section. END_STATUTE
