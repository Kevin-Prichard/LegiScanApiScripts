Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Arizona:
Section1.Section 9-529, Arizona Revised
Statutes, is amended to read:
START_STATUTE9-529.Form of bonds; payment and call; interest; sale; bids;
interim receipts; rates and procedures; definition
A.Bonds issued under this article shall be fully
negotiable within the meaning and for all purposes of title 47. They may be in
one or more series, may bear dates, may be payable in a medium of payment, at
places, may carry registration privileges, shall be executed in a manner, may
contain other terms, covenants and conditions, and shall be in a form as the governing body may
by resolution prescribe. They shall be payable at one time, or from time to
time, in a manner and in maturities not longer than thirty years from their
date as the governing body may prescribe. Any or all of the bonds may be
callable at times, on terms and in a manner as the governing body by resolution
may prescribe.
B.Any or all of the bonds may be sold by calling
for bids at public sale, or through an online
bidding process, or bonds may be sold
under an accelerated bidding process or
by negotiated sale. If sold under an accelerated bidding
process, the bonds shall be sold at the lowest cost the governing body deems
then available after having received at least three pricing quotations from
recognized purchasers of bonds of the type being sold, and if sold at public
sale or through an online bidding process to the person offering the
best bid.
C.The bonds may be sold below, at or above par. If
the bonds are sold below par, the aggregate amount of discount plus interest to
be paid on the bonds must not exceed the amount of interest that would be
payable on the bonds over the maturity schedule prescribed by the governing
body at the maximum rate set out in the resolution calling the election at
which the bonds were voted.
D.If sold at public sale, the governing body shall
call for bids by giving notice of the sale at least once a week for two
successive weeks in cities having a population of fifteen thousand or more
persons according to the most recent
federal census, and once a week for four successive weeks in all
other cities and towns by publication in a newspaper of general circulation
within the county. The notice shall be in the form the governing body
prescribes. If bonds are sold through an online bidding process, bids
for the bonds that are entered into the system may be concealed until a
specified time or disclosed in the online bidding process, may be
subject to improvement in favor of the municipality before a specified time and
may be for an entire issue of bonds or specified maturities according to the
manner, terms and notice provisions ordered by the governing body. These bids
shall be for the entire bond issue unless the governing body by resolution allows
bidding in parcels for less than the entire issue.
E.Notwithstanding any other provision of this
section, bonds may be sold to natural persons residing in this state by
negotiated sale on terms the governing body deems to be the best then available
and may bear interest payable at such times as determined by the governing
body. The bonds may be sold below, at or above par, but if an issue of bonds
is sold below par, the aggregate amount of discount plus interest to be paid on
the bonds must not exceed the amount of interest that would be payable on the
bonds over the maturity schedule prescribed by the governing body at the
maximum rate set out in the resolution calling the election at which the bonds
were voted.
F.Pending preparation of the definitive bonds,
interim receipts or certificates may be issued to the purchasers of the bonds
in a form and with provisions as the governing body may determine.
G.Bonds issued by municipalities may bear interest
at any rate or rates not in excess of the maximum rate of interest set forth in
the resolution calling the election, payable at the times determined by the
governing body, provided that each bond may be evidenced by one instrument, or
if commercial paper by a succession of instruments each bearing interest
payable only at maturity.Bonds or commercial paper issued under
this article shall be subject to the following:
1.The bonds may bear interest at a fixed, variable
or combination rate, none of which exceeds the maximum rate of interest set
forth in the resolution calling the election.
2.A variable rate shall be based on any objective
measure of the current value of money borrowed such as the announced prime rate
of a bank, the rates borne by obligations of the United States or an index or
other formula provided for by the governing body.The governing body
shall employ a recognized agent in municipal bonds to market and remarket the
bonds or commercial paper issued and to establish an interest rate in
accordance with the approved index or formula.
3.The governing body may grant to the owner of any
bond a right to tender or may require the tender of the bond for payment or
purchase at one or more times before maturity and may enter into appropriate
agreements with any bank, other financial institution, insurance company or
indemnity company for the purchase of bonds so tendered. The
agreement may provide that while the bonds are held by the bank, financial
institution, insurance company or indemnity company the bonds may bear interest
at a rate higher than when the bonds are held by other owners, but not in
excess of the maximum rate of interest set forth in the resolution calling the
election.
4.If bonds are tendered before maturity under an
agreement to pay for or purchase bonds when tendered, the municipality may
provide for the purchase and resale of the bonds pursuant to the tenders
without extinguishing the obligation represented by them or incurring a new
obligation on the resale, whether or not the bonds are represented by the same
instruments when purchased as when resold.
5.Compensation for the resale of the bonds shall
not be based on or measured by the difference between the price at which the
bonds are purchased and the price at which they are resold.
6.The governing body may:
(a)Contract with a bank, other financial
institution, insurance company or indemnity company to provide additional
security for the bonds in the form of a line of credit, letter of credit,
insurance policy or other security.
(b)Pay the costs of the additional security from
amounts provided in the bond issue or from other available sources and may
enter into reimbursement obligations in connection with the cost of the
additional security.
7.Any reimbursement obligation entered into with
the bank, financial institution, insurance company or indemnity company shall
not provide for the payment of interest in excess of the maximum rate of
interest set forth in the resolution calling the election.The
reimbursement obligation does not constitute a general obligation of the
municipality and is payable from the same source as the bonds, or from other
available revenues, as determined by the governing body.However,
use of other available revenues does not create an indebtedness under article
IX, section 8, Constitution of Arizona.
8.Variable rate bonds and commercial paper may be
sold at competitive public sale, through an online bidding process or at
negotiated sale.A competitive public sale may be accomplished
pursuant to a notice of sale published at the times and in the manner provided
in this section. The notice shall provide terms and conditions as may be
determined by the governing body.
9.If bonds are to be issued in the form of
commercial paper, the governing body shall first establish the schedule for the
maturities of the bonds within the maximum period permitted by the voted
proposition.The individual instruments representing the bonds may
mature over shorter periods and may be retired before maturity with proceeds of
subsequent instruments, or with the proceeds of definitive bonds, but they
shall be finally paid according to the schedule of bond maturities or earlier.
10.Bonds issued in the form of commercial paper may
be sold through an agent in the form of instruments which mature at intervals
the agent determines to be most advantageous to the issuer after giving public
notice to potential investors as determined by the governing body.
11.Bonds may be issued as compound interest bonds
bearing interest payable only at maturity but compounded periodically until
that date at a fixed rate no higher than the rate set forth in the resolution
calling the election.
H.For purposes of this section, "online
bidding process" means a procurement process in which the governing body
receives bids electronically over the internet in a realtime,
competitive bidding event. END_STATUTE
Sec.2.Section
9-535.01, Arizona Revised Statutes, is amended to read:
START_STATUTE9-535.01.Refunding bonds and revenueproducing undertaking;
refunding utility purchase contracts; form; sale and investment of proceeds;
limitation on amount issued
A.Bonds may also be
issued hereunder for the purpose of refunding any bonds issued under authority
of this article or any bonds issued under the authority of title 35, chapter 3,
article 3 or 4, for the acquisition, construction or improvement of any utility
undertaking.If any city or town has outstanding unpaid balances on
contracts heretofore entered into for the acquisition of water or other utility
properties or facilities and such contracts are payable solely from the
revenues thereof or of the utility undertaking extended or added to with the
properties or facilities so acquired, whether or not title to such properties
or facilities shall have vested in such city or town, all or any part of such
unpaid balances may also be refunded hereunder and all such contracts so
refunded are hereby validated and declared to be effective in accordance with
their terms.No election on the issuance of such bonds shall be
required, but if such bonds are combined into a single issue with bonds
authorized for nonrefunding purposes hereunder, the bonds so authorized for
nonrefunding purposes shall have been submitted at an election as otherwise
provided in this article.
B.Refunding bonds issued hereunder shall have such
details, shall bear such rate or rates of interest, and shall be otherwise
issued, sold and secured as provided by the governing body of the city or town
and as otherwise provided in this article, except that such changes in the
security and revenues pledged to the payment of the obligations so refunded may
be made by the governing body as may be provided by it in the proceedings authorizing
such bonds, but in no event shall such bonds ever become a general obligation
of the municipality issuing such refunding bonds unless such refunding bonds or
the bonds to be refunded are tax secured bonds.
C.Refunding bonds issued hereunder may be exchanged
for no less than a like principal amount of the bonds or unpaid contract
obligations to be refunded, may be sold at a private or public sale or may be
exchanged in part and sold in part.However, if refunding bonds issued hereunder are combined
into a single issue with bonds authorized for nonrefunding purposes, such
nonrefunding bonds shall be sold at a public sale in the manner herein provided
for the sale of other revenue bonds.If sold, the net
proceeds may be invested in obligations issued by the United States government,
or one of its agencies, or obligations fully guaranteed by the United States
government as to principal and interest so long as such investments will mature
with interest so as to provide funds to pay when due, or called for redemption,
the bonds or unpaid contract obligations to be refunded together with interest
thereon and redemption premiums, if any, and such proceeds or obligations
shall, and other funds legally available to the city or town for such purposes
may be deposited in trust with a banking corporation or association doing
business in Arizona which that is a member of the federal
deposit insurance corporation, or any successor thereto, to be held for the
payment and redemption of bonds or unpaid contract obligations to be refunded
and such deposit and any reinvestment thereof shall be held in trust by the
escrow agent for the payment of bonds or unpaid contract obligations with
interest and redemption premiums, if any, on maturity or upon on
an available redemption date or upon on
an earlier voluntary surrender with the consent of the
issuer.As to obligations so escrowed for the payment of contract
balances payable in amounts or at times not fixed but dependent on earnings of
the undertaking, it shall be sufficient if the obligations so purchased, if
liquidated on the market at the par value thereof, will produce enough to pay
such balances as the governing body estimates would have become payable under
the terms of the contracts had such balances not been refunded, but the
escrowed obligations must be not less in principal amount than the principal
amount of the balances so refunded, and if at any time the income from the
escrowed obligations is insufficient to pay all interest when payable on such
refunded balances, such deficiencies shall be made up from the earnings of the
undertaking on such priority basis as would have been applicable to such
payment had such balances not been refunded.The term "net
proceeds" as used above shall mean the gross proceeds of the refunding
bonds after the deduction therefrom of all accrued interest and expenses
incurred in connection with the authorization and issuance of the bonds and the
refunding of the outstanding obligations, including all cost and expenses
resulting from price variation to par or otherwise incurred in the purchase of
obligations for escrow and in the distribution of the refunding
bonds.The determination of the governing body issuing refunding
bonds that the limitations herein imposed upon on the
issuance of refunding bonds have been met shall be conclusive in the absence of
fraud or arbitrary and gross abuse of discretion.
D.Bonds or unpaid contract obligations not maturing
or callable for redemption under their terms may not be refunded hereunder without
the consent of the holders unless the proceedings authorizing the issuance of
the refunded bonds provide that they may be so refunded.
E.With respect to bonds issued to refund tax
secured bonds, the provisions of title 35, chapter 3, article 4 shall govern in
the event of any inconsistency between such article and this section. END_STATUTE

resolution by a majority of the voters voting at such election, may pledge its
full faith and credit for the payment of the bonds, and if such pledge is made,

Sec.17.Section 48-721, Arizona Revised
Statutes, is amended to read:
START_STATUTE48-721.Special assessments; assessment lien bonds
A.The district board, by resolution and pursuant to
the procedures prescribed by sections 48576 through 48589, as
nearly as practicable, or such other procedures as the district board provides,
may levy an assessment of the costs of any public infrastructure purpose, any
operation and maintenance of public infrastructure or any enhanced municipal
services on any land in the district based on the benefit determined by the
district board to be received by the land. Prior to the issuance of special
assessment bonds the district may enter into a written agreement with a
landowner as to the manner in which the assessment is to be allocated if the
land is to be divided into more than one parcel. If an issue of special
assessment lien bonds finances more than one purpose or service, the benefit
received by the land, in the discretion of the district, may be determined by
reference to the purposes and services as a whole or
individually.The assessment may be based on estimated costs and amended
to reflect actual costs, and the preparation of plans and specifications and
the awarding of the contract are not a prerequisite to the levying of the
assessment.An owner of land on which an assessment has been levied
may seek judicial review of whether the land is benefited by the proposed
infrastructure, on the merits, by special action filed with the court of
appeals pursuant to the procedures of section 48706, within thirty days of after the effective date of the resolution.
B.After adoption by the district board of a
resolution levying a special assessment on property in the district pursuant to
section 48709, subsection A, paragraph 11 the district board may issue
and sell special assessment lien bonds payable from amounts collected from the
special assessments, from amounts available from time to time in any reserve
fund established for those bonds and from any other amounts available for those
purposes as prescribed by section 48717. The district and the county
treasurer for the county in which the district is located may enter into an
agreement for the county treasurer to collect the district's special
assessments in the manner and by the officers provided by law for the
collection and enforcement of general taxes. The district and the county
treasurer may provide by agreement for the payment of the county treasurer's
collection expenses directly related to the levy of the special assessment and,
if so provided, the levy of the special assessment may include an amount for
compensation of the county treasurer directly related to the collection of the
special assessment. The compensation received by the county treasurer pursuant
to the agreement shall be governed by section 11-496. The district board may
also issue and sell bond anticipation notes pursuant to the procedures
prescribed in section 482081 or with procedures as similar to those as
is practicable. The assessment shall be a first lien on the property assessed
subject only to general property taxes and prior special assessments.In
the event of nonpayment of an assessment and except as otherwise provided in an
agreement between the district and the county treasurer pursuant to this
section, the procedures for collection of delinquent assessments, sale of
delinquent property and issuance and effect of the superintendent's deed
prescribed by sections 48601 through 48607 apply, as nearly as
practicable, except that in no event is the district or the municipality
required to purchase the delinquent land at the sale if there is no other
purchaser. If the landowner owns more than one parcel in the district, the
district board may provide procedures for the collection and enforcement of
assessments as the board deems appropriate by contract with a landowner to
permit the sale of any or all of the landowner's parcels in the district if the
landowner becomes delinquent as to any parcel that the landowner owns in the
district.
C.On adoption of the resolution, but before
issuance of the special assessment lien bonds, the district may direct the
treasurer to make demand on the owners of the property so assessed, as shown on
the property tax roll, for advance payment of the amount assessed. The demand
shall state a date not less than twenty days after the date of adoption of the
ordinance after which the treasurer may refuse to accept advance payments of
the assessment.The treasurer shall certify to the clerk on or after
the date specified in the demand the amount collected and the assessments
remaining unpaid against each parcel of land assessed. Special assessment lien
bonds may not be issued in an amount in excess of the amount assessed in the
ordinance or, if advance payments are demanded, the amount certified to the
clerk. The district may adopt procedures for prepayment and provisions for
payment and reallocation of assessments.
D.The district, by resolution and pursuant to the procedures prescribed by
article 4 of THIS CHAPTER, as nearly as practicable, may issue
and sell refunding bonds to refund any special assessment bonds of the
district. END_STATUTE
