A CONCURRENT MEMORIAL

urging the United
States Congress to direct the American Legion to expand its membership
eligibility.

(TEXT OF BILL BEGINS ON NEXT PAGE)





To the Congress of the United States of America:
Your memorialist respectfully represents:
Whereas, according to the American Legion, the organization was
chartered and incorporated by Congress in 1919 as a patriotic veterans
organization devoted to mutual helpfulness. As the nation's largest wartime
veterans service organization, the American Legion is committed to mentoring
youth and sponsoring wholesome programs in our communities, advocating
patriotism and honor, promoting strong national security and providing support
to fellow servicemembers and veterans; and
Whereas, the American Legion limits membership eligibility to
those who have served federal active duty in the United States Armed Forces
during the World War I era, World War II era, Korean War era, Vietnam War era,
Lebanon/Grenada era, Panama era or Persian Gulf War era and who have been
honorably discharged or are still serving; and
Whereas, all honorably discharged military veterans deserve the
opportunity to participate in the American Legion.
Wherefore your
memorialist, the House of Representatives of the State of Arizona, the Senate
concurring, prays:
1.That the United
States Congress direct the American Legion to expand its membership eligibility
to include all honorably discharged military veterans.
2.That the Secretary of
State of the State of Arizona transmit copies of this Memorial to the President
of the United States, the Speaker of the United States House of
Representatives, the President of the United States Senate and each Member of
Congress from the State of Arizona.
