START_STATUTE14-5312.01.Inpatient treatment; rights and duties of ward and
guardian
A.Except as provided in subsection B of this
section, a guardian of an incapacitated person may consent to psychiatric and
psychological care and treatment, including the administration of psychotropic
medications, if the care and treatment take place outside a level one behavioral health an inpatient psychiatric facility licensed by
the department of health services.
B.On clear and convincing evidence that the ward is an incapacitated as a result of a mental disorder as defined in
section 36501, person
and is likely to be in need of inpatient mental health care and
treatment within the period of the authority granted pursuant to this section,
the court may authorize a guardian appointed pursuant to this title to give
consent for the ward to receive inpatient mental health care and treatment,
including placement in a level one
behavioral health an inpatient
psychiatric facility licensed by the department of health
services and medical, psychiatric and psychological treatment associated with
that placement.The evidence shall be supported by the opinion of a
mental health expert who is either a physician licensed pursuant to title 32,
chapter 13 or 17 and who is a specialist in psychiatry or a psychologist who is
licensed pursuant to title 32, chapter 19.1.
C.In making its decision to grant authority to a
guardian pursuant to subsection B of this section, the court shall consider the
cause of the ward's disability and the ward's foreseeable clinical
needs.The court shall limit the guardian's authority to what is
reasonably necessary to obtain the care required for the ward in the least restrictive
treatment alternative. The court may limit the duration of the guardian's
authority to consent to inpatient mental health care and treatment and include
other orders the court determines necessary to protect the ward's best
interests.
D.Within fortyeight hours after placement of
the ward pursuant to this section, the guardian shall give notice of this
action to the ward's attorney. When the attorney receives this notice the
attorney shall assess the appropriateness of the placement pursuant to section
36537, subsection B and section 36546, subsection
H.If requested by the attorney, the court shall hold a hearing on
the appropriateness of the placement within three days after receiving that
request.
E.The behavioral
health treatment inpatient
psychiatric facility shall assess the appropriateness of the
ward's placement every thirty days and shall provide a copy of the assessment
report to the ward's attorney on
request.The ward's attorney may attend the ward's
evaluation, staffing, treatment team and case management meetings.
F.When the ward is admitted to a level one behavioral health treatment an inpatient psychiatric
facility pursuant to this section, the guardian shall provide the facility with
the name, address and telephone number of the ward's attorney. The facility
shall include this information in the ward's treatment record.
G.Within twentyfour hours after the facility
receives any writing in which the ward requests release from the facility, any
change in placement or a change in the type or duration of treatment, the
facility shall forward this information to the ward's attorney.
H.All health care providers, treatment facilities
and regional behavioral health authorities shall allow the ward's attorney
access to all of the ward's medical, psychiatric, psychological and other
treatment records.
I.The ward's guardian shall place the ward in a
least restrictive treatment alternative within five days after the guardian is
notified by the medical director of the inpatient facility that the ward no
longer needs inpatient care.The ward, a representative of the
inpatient treatment facility, the ward's attorney, the ward's physician or any
other interested person may petition the court to order the facility to
discharge the ward to a least restrictive treatment alternative if the guardian
does not act promptly to do so.
J.If the ward is in a behavioral health treatment an inpatient psychiatric facility at the time
of the initial hearing on the petition for appointment of a guardian, the court
investigator and the ward's attorney shall advise the court of the
appropriateness of the placement.
K.An attorney appointed pursuant to section 145303,
subsection C remains the attorney of record until the attorney is discharged by
the court. The court shall ensure that a ward whose guardian has been granted inpatient mental health
treatment authority is represented by an attorney at all times the guardian has
that authority.Unless the court finds that the ward has
insufficient assets to meet the ward's reasonable and necessary care and living
expenses, the ward shall pay the attorney's reasonable fees.
L.If deemed necessary to adequately assess a
request for inpatient mental
health treatment authority or to review the ward's placement in a behavioral health treatment an inpatient psychiatric
facility, the court may order an independent evaluation by either a physician
who is licensed pursuant to title 32, chapter 13 or 17 and who is a specialist
in psychiatry or a psychologist who is licensed pursuant to title 32, chapter
19.1.If the ward has insufficient funds to pay the total cost of
this evaluation, the court may deem all or any part of the evaluator's fee to
be a county expense after determining the reasonableness of that fee. 
M.Instead of ordering an independent evaluation
pursuant to subsection L of this section, the court may accept a report
conducted on behalf of the behavioral
health treatment inpatient
psychiatric facility if the court finds that the report meets the
requirements of an independent evaluation.
N.The court may decide that the ward's right to
retain or obtain a driver license and any other civil right that may be
suspended by operation of law is not affected by the appointment of a guardian.
O.If the court grants the guardian the authority to
consent to inpatient mental health care and treatment pursuant to this section,
the medical director of a level one
behavioral health an
inpatient psychiatric facility licensed by the department of
health services may admit the ward at the guardian's request.
P.A guardian who is authorized by the court to
consent to inpatient mental health care and treatment pursuant to this section
shall file with the annual report of the guardian required pursuant to section
145315 an evaluation report by a physician or a psychologist who meets
the requirements of subsection B of this section.The evaluation
report shall indicate if the ward will likely need inpatient mental health care
and treatment within the period of the authority granted pursuant to this
section.If the guardian does not file the evaluation report or if
the report indicates that the ward will not likely need inpatient mental health
care and treatment, the guardian's authority to consent to this treatment ceases
on the expiration of the period specified in the prior court order. If the
report supports the continuation of the guardian's authority to consent to
inpatient treatment, the court may order that the guardian's authority to
consent to this treatment continues.If the report supports the
continuation of the guardian's authority to consent to this treatment, the
ward's attorney shall review the report with the ward.The ward may
contest the continuation of the guardian's authority by filing a request for a
court hearing within ten business days after the report is
filed.The court shall hold this hearing within thirty calendar days
after it receives the request. The guardian's authority continues pending the
court's ruling on the issue. At the hearing the guardian has the burden of
proving by clear and convincing evidence that the ward is likely to be in need
of inpatient mental health care and treatment within the period of the
authority granted pursuant to this section.
Q.The court may discharge an attorney who was
appointed pursuant to section 145303, subsection C subsequent to the
appointment of a guardian if it clearly appears from specific facts presented
by affidavit or verified petition that continued representation of the ward is
no longer necessary or desirable. The factual basis must include, at a
minimum, consideration of the following:
1.The nature and history of the ward's illness.
2.The ward's history of hospitalization.
3.The ward's current and anticipated living
arrangements.
4.Whether the ward's inpatient treatment is
anticipated to be a onetime hospitalization for the purpose of
stabilizing the ward's condition and further hospitalizations are not likely to
be necessary.
5.Whether the ward's current and anticipated living
arrangements are the least restrictive alternatives possible. END_STATUTE
