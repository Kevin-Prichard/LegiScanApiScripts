because of, theft, embezzlement, fraud or misappropriation of an employer's property

restitution and fines imposed by a court of competent jurisdiction. The court

from the system more or less than the member or beneficiary would have been
entitled to receive had the records been correct, the local board shall correct
such error, and as far as practicable shall adjust the payments in such manner
that the actuarial equivalent of the benefit to which such member or
beneficiary was correctly entitled shall be paid.If a member is
convicted of a crime specified in this subsection, section 13713

transferred to the member as a severance refund plus an amount, computed by the
system's actuary that is necessary to equal the increase in the actuarial
