(TEXT OF BILL BEGINS ON NEXT PAGE)





To the President,
Secretary of State and Congress of the United States of America:
Your memorialist respectfully represents:
Whereas, it is a time-honored
tradition that the United States of America strives to ensure that all United
States citizens held captive overseas are returned safely to their families and
loved ones; and
Whereas, Robert Levinson honorably
served the United States as a law enforcement officer in both the United States
Drug Enforcement Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation; and
Whereas, Robert Levinson was taken
captive on the Kish Island in Iran on March 9, 2007; and
Whereas, several Americans who have
been held captive in Iran were recently released, but Robert Levinson was not
among them; and
Whereas, it is a duty and
obligation of the United States to Robert Levinson and his family to ascertain
his whereabouts and secure his safe release.
Wherefore your
memorialist, the House of Representatives of the State of Arizona, the Senate
concurring, prays:
1.That the President of
the United States, the United States Congress, the United States Secretary of
State and all public officials under their charge follow the policy of the
United States as stated in United States Senate Concurrent Resolution 16:
It is the policy of the United
States that--
(1)[T]he Government of the Islamic Republic of
Iran should immediately . . . cooperate with the United States Government to
locate and return Robert Levinson; and
(2)[T]he United States Government should
undertake every effort using every diplomatic tool at its disposal to secure
[his] immediate release.
2.That the Secretary of
State of the State of Arizona transmit copies of this Memorial to the President
of the United States, the Secretary of State of the United States, the Speaker
of the United States House of Representatives, the President of the United
States Senate and each Member of Congress from the State of Arizona.
