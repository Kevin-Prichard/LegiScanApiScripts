A CONCURRENT MEMORIAL

urging the United
States Congress to enact the Stopping EPA Overreach Act.


(TEXT OF BILL BEGINS ON NEXT PAGE)





To the Congress of the United States of America:
Your memorialist respectfully represents:
Whereas, the Stopping EPA Overreach Act seeks to prevent the
United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from exceeding its
statutory authority in ways that were not contemplated by the United States
Congress; and
Whereas, in the Stopping EPA Overreach Act, the State of
Arizona urges Congress to find that:
(1)The EPA has exceeded its statutory authority by
promulgating regulations that were not contemplated by Congress in the
authorizing language of the statutes enacted by Congress;
(2)The EPA was correct not to classify greenhouse
gases as pollutants prior to 2009;
(3)No federal agency has the authority to regulate
greenhouse gases under current law; and
(4)No attempt to regulate greenhouse gases should
be undertaken without further congressional action; and
Whereas, the Stopping EPA Overreach Act should clarify that
federal agencies do not have the authority to regulate climate change or global
warming, thereby voiding certain EPA rules, and requires the Administrator of
the EPA to provide an analysis of any regulation, rule or policy that describes
its impacts on employment and jobs in the United States before proposing or
finalizing that regulation, rule or policy; and
Whereas, any federal agency seeking to promulgate a regulation,
rule or policy should be required to provide the cost-benefit analysis and peerreviewed
science that were used in proposing the regulation, rule or policy; and
Whereas, penalties should be imposed for knowingly providing
false information as support for a proposed regulation, rule or policy; and
Whereas, the people of Arizona fully support the Stopping EPA
Overreach Act.
Wherefore your
memorialist, the Senate of the State of Arizona, the House of Representatives
concurring, prays:
1.That the United
States Congress enact the Stopping EPA Overreach Act.
2.That the Secretary of
State of the State of Arizona transmit copies of this Memorial to the President
of the United States, the Speaker of the United States House of
Representatives, the President of the United States Senate and each Member of
Congress from the State of Arizona.
