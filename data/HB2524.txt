CHAPTER 31.1
UNIFORM FIREARMS
TRANSFER COMPACT
START_STATUTE13-3161.Adoption of compact; text of compact
The state of Arizona enacts, adopts and agrees to be bound
by the following Compact:
ARTICLE I
FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF POLICY
Whereas 4 United States Code section 112 gives congressional
consent "to any two or more states to enter into agreements or compacts
for cooperative effort and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime and in
the enforcement of their respective criminal laws and policies, and to
establish such agencies, joint or otherwise, as they may deem desirable for
making effective such agreements and compacts."
Whereas every state adopting and agreeing to be bound by
this compact, each of which have or may enact reciprocal recognition of
regulations affecting firearms transfers, finds that maintaining uniformity in
firearms transfer laws as provided herein advances their mutual sovereign
interests in protecting the reasonable expectations of their respective
citizens and law enforcement community;
Whereas every state adopting and agreeing to be bound by this
compact promises and agrees to maintain reliably uniform firearms transfer laws
as herein provided to ensure uniformity in public policy in order to promote a
better public understanding of the law when their citizens travel or establish
residences or domiciles among member states, to govern, coordinate, and guide
civil and criminal law enforcement personnel when interacting with such
citizens, and to avoid undesirable state burdens on interstate commerce in
firearms;
Now, therefore, in consideration of their mutual promises
and obligations expressed in this compact, be it enacted by every state
enacting, adopting and agreeing to be bound by this compact, their agreement to
exercise herewith all of their respective powers as set forth herein
notwithstanding any law, regulation or policy to the contrary.
ARTICLE II
DEFINITIONS
As used in this compact, unless the context clearly
indicates otherwise:
Section 1."Compact" means the
"Uniform Firearms Transfer Compact."
Section 2."State" means one of the several
states of the United States. The term "state" shall be construed to
include all of its branches, departments, agencies, instrumentalities,
political subdivisions, and officers, employees and representatives acting in
their official capacity.
Section 3."Member state" means a state
that has passed legislation that enacts, adopts and agrees to be bound to this
compact. For any state to qualify as a member state with respect to any other
state under this compact, each such state must have enacted, adopted and agreed
to be bound by substantively identical legislation enacting, adopting and
agreeing to be bound by this compact. Legislation enacting, adopting and
agreeing to be bound by the compact shall be deemed substantively identical
notwithstanding the inclusion of a section in such legislation entitled
"Addendum to Compact," which specifies laws, regulations, and
policies, and related prosecutions or administrative or enforcement actions,
existing or pending on the enactment date of such legislation in the respective
enacting state that are excluded from the scope of section 1 of article IV of
this compact as provided by section 2 of article IV of this compact, provided
that such legislation is otherwise identical in all operative terms.
Section 4."Notice" All notices
required by this compact shall be by United States certified mail, return
receipt requested, or an equivalent or superior form of notice, such as
personal delivery documented by evidence of actual receipt.
Section5."Federal law" exclusively
means duly enacted, constitutional federal statutes and lawfully and
constitutionally promulgated regulations promulgated in conformity with the
administrative procedure act, as amended.
ARTICLE III
COMPACT MEMBERSHIP AND WITHDRAWAL
Section 1.By becoming a member state, each such
state offers to perform and comply strictly in accordance with this Compact's
terms and conditions, and has made such offer in anticipation and consideration
of, and in substantial reliance upon, such mutual and reciprocal performance
and compliance by each other member state, if any. Such offer shall be deemed
accepted and entry into this Compact complete upon the receipt of notice of the
attainment of Member State status by each other member state's governor or
other acting chief executive officer, if any. Upon such entry, this compact
and each of its articles shall be construed and enforced as a solemn sovereign
agreement legally and contractually binding on each member state.
Section 2.After this Compact becomes legally and
contractually binding on a Member State, that Member State reserves the right
to withdraw from or propose amendments to this Compact: (a)during every tenth year after
the first State passes legislation enacting, adopting and agreeing to be bound
to this Compact; (b)during
a special session of that Member State's legislature called specifically for
the purpose of introducing legislation allowing for withdrawal from or
proposing amendments to this Compact, provided that written notice of the call
of such special session is given to each other Member State at least thirty
(30) days before the session convenes; or (c)upon unanimous consent of each other Member
State given in writing by such Member State's respective Governor or other
acting Chief Executive Officer. Any proposed amendment to this Compact
authorized by this section shall only be effective if and when legislatively
adopted by a twothirds majority of Member States within three (3) years
of the first enactment of legislation proposing the amendment, with the
minority of nonadopting Member States deemed to have then-withdrawn from the
Compact unless the amendment only affects the Member States that have adopted
the amendment.However, a Member State may at any time repeal any or
all provisions of an "Addendum to Compact", for which it is
responsible, as contemplated in section 2 of Article IV of this Compact, as
well as any law, regulation or policy specified therein, that is included as a
section within its respective legislation enacting, adopting and agreeing to be
bound by this Compact; with the remainder of the Compact remaining in full
force and effect. 
Section3.A withdrawal, or amendment
intended to affect only a particular member state, shall not affect the
validity or applicability of the compact with respect to remaining member
states, provided that there remain at least two such states.
ARTICLE IV
UNIFORMITY REQUIREMENT
SECTION 1. Except as
expressly provided in Section 2 of this Article, each Member State shall not:
(a)create,
impose or enforce any fee, tax, penalty, mandate or regulation governing,
punishing, restricting, conditioning or otherwise burdening in any respect or
at any time the transfer of firearms by any person, if such fee, tax, penalty,
mandate or regulation would be in addition to any such fee, tax, penalty,
mandate or regulation imposed by federal law; or (b)create, impose or enforce any
criminal or civil liability not created or imposed under federal law in
connection with the transfer of firearms by any person.
Section 2. Section 1
of this article shall not apply to: (a)the creation, imposition or enforcement of a
fee, tax, penalty, mandate, regulation, or criminal or civil liability, or
related prosecution or administrative or enforcement action, where the transfer
of firearms is an element of a criminal or civil cause of action involving
violence, the violation of property rights, attempted or threatened violence or
the violation of property rights, controlled substances, actual fraud, breach of
contract, or intentional or negligent misconduct actually causing or imminently
threatening personal or economic injury; or (b) any law, regulation or policy, or related prosecution or
administrative or enforcement action that is specified by a member state in a
section entitled "Addendum to Compact" and included within its
respective legislation enacting, adopting and agreeing to be bound by this
compact, provided that the specified law, regulation or policy is existing and
effective, or the prosecution or administrative or enforcement is pending, in
the Member State on the enactment date of its legislation enacting, adopting
and agreeing to be bound to this Compact. Said Addendum to Compact, if any,
shall be regarded as part of this Compact with respect to the respectively
enacting Member State, and, except as it qualifies section 1 of this Article,
shall otherwise be construed as subject to the Compact's terms.
Section 3. Unrebutted
prima facie evidence that a law, regulation or policy, or related prosecution,
or administrative or enforcement action, violates section 1 of this Article
shall be a complete defense in all Member States to any civil or criminal
proceeding against any person in relation to the transfer of a firearm to the
extent that the proceeding arises from the authority of such law, regulation or
policy. Any party prevailing in the defense afforded by this section shall be
entitled to recover in the same proceeding all legal expenses, including
reasonable attorney fees, from any party seeking to enforce any such
conflicting law, regulation or policy.
Section
4.Intended Third Party Beneficiaries.Intended third
party beneficiaries of this Compact, who are hereby granted a vested right to
the strict performance thereof by Member States, include, but are not limited
to, residents of Member States who: (a)enjoy the right to keep and bear arms for
self-defense, defense of home, or defense of community under state or federal
law or their respective state constitution or the United States Constitution; (b)enjoy a protected property
interest in any firearm under state or federal law or their respective state
constitution or the United States Constitution; (c)enjoy a protected contractual interest in the
transfer of any firearm under state or federal law or their respective state
constitution or the United States Constitution; (d)enjoy a protected liberty interest in the
transfer of any firearm under state or federal law or their respective state
constitution or the United States Constitution; or (e)qualify for the defense afforded
by Section 3 of this Article.
ARTICLE V
CONSTRUCTION, ENFORCEMENT, VENUE AND
SEVERABILITY
Section 1.Any law, regulation or policy existing
on the effective date of this Compact, which is in conflict with this Compact,
shall hereby be repealed and held for naught to the extent of such
conflict.However, nothing in this Compact is intended to supersede
federal law except as may be authorized by the provisions of 4 United States
Code section 112.
Section 2.Any violation of Article IV of this
Compact, whether by state constitutional amendment, legislative act, popular
initiative, or administrative act, or related prosecution, administrative or
enforcement action, is a material breach of this Compact. Any breach of this
Compact by any Member State, whether by state constitutional amendment,
legislative act, popular initiative, or administrative act, or related
prosecution, administrative or enforcement action, shall be regarded by all
Member States as a substantial impairment of the obligation of a solemn
contract between Sovereigns, and as an ultra vires and void violation of United
States Constitution, Article I, section 10, clause 1. Further, any such breach
by virtue of any Member State's criminal investigations, prosecutions or
adjudications shall be regarded by all Member States as an ultra vires and void
violation of United States Constitution, Article VI, clause 2, due to the
existence of advance statutory congressional consent under 4 United States Code
section 112 for the criminal law enforcement coordination required by this
compact.
Section 3. Any member state resident, who is an intended
third party beneficiary of this compact, shall have standing in the courts of
any member state to seek declaratory, injunctive or other appropriate relief to
enforce this compact as a duly authorized agent of the member state of his or
her residency provided that the following conditions are first met: (a)such resident shall give
reasonable notice of the alleged noncompliance with this compact to the entity
directly responsible for such noncompliance and also to the attorney general or
other chief law enforcement officer, if any, of the member state in which such
entity is domiciled, within sixty (60) days of said resident's actual discovery
of the first instance of noncompliance; (b)the aforesaid responsible entity fails to cure
such noncompliance within thirty (30) days of such notice; and (c)the attorney general or other
chief law enforcement officer, if any, of the member state in which such entity
is domiciled shall fail to enforce this compact by filing an appropriate
action, as necessary to ensure compliance within sixty (60) days of the
expiration of such cure period.
Section 4.This compact shall be liberally
construed so as to effectuate its purposes.To the extent that the
effectiveness of this compact or any of its articles or provisions requires the
alteration of locallegislative rules, legislative drafting policies
or statutes, or parliamentary procedure to be effective, the enactment of
legislation enacting, adopting and agreeing to be bound by this compact shall
be deemed to waive, repeal, supersede, or otherwise amend and conform all such
rules, policies, statutes or procedures to allow for the effectiveness of all
provisions of this compact according to their terms and conditions to the
fullest extent permitted by the constitution of any affected member state,
consistent with the prohibition on states impairing the obligation of contract
under United States Constitution, article I, section 10, clause 1. In the event
that the purposes of this compact cannot be fulfilled due to defects in form or
style, each affected member state shall take all reasonable steps, both
legislative or otherwise, that will remedy such defects and ensure that the
purposes of this compact are not frustrated by formal or stylistic
defects.However, the definitions specified in this compact shall
govern this compact unless the context clearly and unequivocally indicates otherwise.
Section 5.If any phrase, clause, sentence or
provision of this compact, or the applicability of any phrase, clause, sentence
or provision of this compact to any government, agency, person or circumstance,
is declared in a final judgment to be contrary to the United States
Constitution, contrary to the state constitution of any member state, subject
to the prohibition on states impairing the obligation of contract under United
States Constitution, article I, section 10, Clause 1, or is otherwise held
invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such phrase, clause, sentence or
provision shall be severed and held for naught, and the validity of the
remainder of this compact and the applicability of the remainder of this
compact to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be
affected. Furthermore, if this compact is declared in a final judgment by a
court of competent jurisdiction to be entirely contrary to the state
constitution of any member state, subject to the prohibition on states
impairing the obligation of contract under united states constitution, article
I, section 10, Clause 1, or otherwise entirely invalid as to any member state,
such member state shall be deemed to have withdrawn from the compact, and the
compact shall remain in full force and effect as to any remaining member
state. Finally, if this compact or any amendment thereto is declared in a
final judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to be wholly or
substantially in violation of article I, section 10, of the United States
Constitution, then it shall be construed and enforced solely as reciprocal
legislation enacted by the affected member state(s).
Section 6.Through the passage of substantively
identical legislation, a simple majority of the member states may organize an
interstate alternative dispute resolution commission with binding and/or
nonbinding authority to mediate and/or settle any dispute, claim or cause of
action arising between and/or among the member states and/or third party
beneficiaries regarding the interpretation or applicability of any provision of
this compact.
Section 7.The effective date of this compact is
the earliest date permitted by law. END_STATUTE
