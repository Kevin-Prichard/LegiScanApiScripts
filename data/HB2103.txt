foster parent.
2.If the activity includes the child leaving the
jurisdiction of the court for a period not to exceed thirty days, the agency or
division that placed the child may give permission on request of the foster
parent.
3.If the activity is one which
that is associated with a school or organization not prohibited
by rule of the division, the foster parents of the child may give permission.
B.The state shall indemnify and hold harmless the
agency or foster parents for liability that may be incurred or alleged as a
result of giving permission pursuant to subsection A of this section if it is reasonably and
prudently given. The state shall provide the defense of any action alleging
such liability.
C.A child placed in foster care has the right to
maintain contact with friends and other
relatives unless the court has determined that contact is not in the child's
best interests as determined pursuant to a court hearing.

and placed in out-of-home placement, guardianship or adoptive placement, the
department shall make reasonable efforts to place that child with the child's
siblings or, if that is not possible, to maintain frequent visitation or other
ongoing contact between the child and the child's siblings unless a court
determines that either the placement or the visitation or contact would be
contrary to the child's or a sibling's safety or well-being. END_STATUTE
