honoring Arizona's first responders.


(TEXT OF BILL BEGINS ON NEXT PAGE)





Whereas, first responders risk their own safety and personal
property in the execution of their duties to protect the public on a daily
basis; and
Whereas, first
responders are the first line of defense for the public against threats, both
domestic and foreign; and
Whereas, first
responders stand at the ready to come to the aid of United States citizens
twenty-four hours a day; and
Whereas, first
responders are a vital part of our communities, not only standing ready to deal
with emergencies but also volunteering in our schools and community
organizations; and
Whereas, both career
and volunteer individuals from police, fire, emergency medical services, search
and rescue and other organizations in the public safety sector come together as
a collective to aid the public in the event of an emergency; and
Whereas, the people of
Arizona wish to honor, recognize and thank the first responders who serve and
protect them.
Therefore
Be it resolved by the Senate of the State of Arizona, the House
of Representatives concurring:
That the Members of the Legislature honor and express their
sincere gratitude to all first responders in the State of Arizona.
