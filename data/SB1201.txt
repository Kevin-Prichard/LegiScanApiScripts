Statutes, is amended to read:
START_STATUTE15-701.01.High school; graduation; requirements; community college
or university courses; transfer from private schools; academic credit
A.The state board of education shall:
1.Prescribe a minimum course of study, as defined
in section 15101 and incorporating the academic standards adopted by the
state board of education, for the graduation of pupils from high school.
2.Prescribe competency requirements for the
graduation of pupils from high school incorporating the academic standards in
at least the areas of reading, writing, mathematics, science and social
studies. The academic standards prescribed by the state board of education in
social studies shall include personal finance.This paragraph does
not allow the state board of education to establish a required separate
personal finance course for the purpose of the graduation of pupils from high
school.Beginning in the 20162017 school year, the competency
requirements for social studies shall include a requirement that, in order to
graduate from high school or obtain a high school equivalency diploma, a pupil
must correctly answer at least sixty of the one hundred questions listed on a
test that is identical to the civics portion of the naturalization test used by
the United States citizenship and immigration services. A district school or
charter school shall document on the pupil's transcript that the pupil has
passed a test that is identical to the civics portion of the naturalization
test used by the United States citizenship and immigration services as required
by this section and shall ensure that
voter registration materials are available at the location where this test is
administered.
3.Develop and adopt competency tests pursuant to
section 15741. English language learners who are subject to article 3.1
of this chapter are subject to the assessments prescribed in section 15741.
B.The governing board of a school district shall:
1.Prescribe curricula that include the academic
standards in the required subject areas pursuant to subsection A, paragraph 1
of this section.
2.Prescribe criteria for the graduation of pupils
from the high schools in the school district. These criteria shall include
accomplishment of the academic standards in at least reading, writing, mathematics,
science and social studies, as determined by district assessment. Other
criteria may include additional measures of academic achievement and
attendance. Pursuant to the prescribed graduation requirements adopted by the
state board of education, the governing board may approve a rigorous computer
science course that would fulfill a mathematics course required for graduation
from high school.The governing board may approve a rigorous
computer science course only if the rigorous computer science course includes
significant mathematics content and the governing board determines the high
school where the rigorous computer science course is offered has sufficient
capacity, infrastructure
and qualified staff, including
competent teachers of computer science. The school district governing board or
charter school governing body may determine the method and manner in which to
administer a test that is identical to the civics portion of the naturalization
test used by the United States citizenship and immigration services. A pupil
who does not obtain a passing score on the test that is identical to the civics
portion of the naturalization test may retake the test until the pupil obtains
a passing score.

study and competency requirements for the graduation of pupils from high school
that are in addition to or higher than the course of study and competency
requirements that the state board prescribes.
D.The governing board may prescribe competency
requirements for the passage of pupils in courses that are required for
graduation from high school.
E.A teacher shall determine whether to pass or fail
a pupil in a course in high school as provided in section 15521,
paragraph 4 on the basis of the competency requirements, if any have been
prescribed.The governing board, if it reviews the decision of a
teacher to pass or fail a pupil in a course in high school as provided in
section 15342, paragraph 11, shall base its decision on the competency
requirements, if any have been prescribed.
F.Graduation requirements established by the
governing board may be met by a pupil who passes courses in the required or
elective subjects at a community college or university, if the course is at a
higher level than the course taught in the high school attended by the pupil
or, if the course is not taught in the high school, the level of the course is
equal to or higher than the level of a high school course.The
governing board shall determine if the subject matter of the community college
or university course is appropriate to the specific requirement the pupil
intends it to fulfill and if the level of the community college or university
course is less than, equal to or higher than a high school course, and the
governing board shall award onehalf of a carnegie unit for each three
semester hours of credit the pupil earns in an appropriate community college or
university course.If a pupil is not satisfied with the decision of
the governing board regarding the amount of credit granted or the subjects for
which credit is granted, the pupil may request that the state board of
education review the decision of the governing board, and the state board shall
make the final determination of the amount of credit to be given the pupil and
for which subjects.The governing board shall not limit the number
of credits that is required for high school graduation and that may be met by

pupil takes an examination and receives a passing score on a test designed and
evaluated by a teacher in the school district who teaches the subject matter on
which the examination is based. In addition to the above requirements, the
governing board of a school district may prescribe requirements for the acceptance
of the credits of pupils who transfer from a private school.
H.If a pupil who was previously enrolled in a
charter school or school district enrolls in a school district in this state,
the school district shall accept credits earned by the pupil in courses or
instructional programs at the charter school or school district. The governing
board of a school district may adopt a policy concerning the application of
transfer credits for the purpose of determining whether a credit earned by a
pupil who was previously enrolled in a school district or charter school will
be assigned as an elective or core credit.
I.A pupil who transfers credit from a charter
school, a school district
or Arizona online instruction shall be provided with a list that indicates which
credits have been accepted as an elective credit and which credits have been
accepted as a core credit by the school district or charter

district or charter school who teaches the subject matter on which the
examination is based. If a pupil is enrolled in a school district or charter
school and that pupil also participates in Arizona online instruction between

pupil who is eligible for a Grand Canyon diploma may elect to remain in high
school through grade twelve and shall not be prevented from enrolling at a high
school after the pupil becomes eligible for a Grand Canyon diploma.A
pupil who is eligible for a Grand Canyon diploma and who elects not to pursue
