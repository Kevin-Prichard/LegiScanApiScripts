(TEXT OF BILL BEGINS ON NEXT PAGE)





Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Arizona:
Section1.Section 25-318, Arizona Revised
Statutes, is amended to read:
START_STATUTE25-318.Disposition of property; retroactivity; notice to
creditors; assignment of debts; contempt of court
A.In a proceeding for dissolution of the marriage,
or for legal separation, or in a proceeding for disposition of property
following dissolution of the marriage by a court which that
previously lacked personal jurisdiction over the absent spouse or
previously lacked jurisdiction to dispose of the property, the court shall
assign each spouse's sole and separate property to such spouse. Except as provided in section 25318.02,
it shall also divide the community, joint tenancy and other property held in
common equitably, though not necessarily in kind, without regard to marital
misconduct. For the purposes of this section only, property acquired by either
spouse outside this state shall be deemed to be community property if the
property would have been community property if acquired in this state.
B.In dividing property, the court may consider all
debts and obligations that are related to the property, including accrued or
accruing taxes that would become due on the receipt, sale or other disposition
of the property.The court may also consider the exempt status of
particular property pursuant to title
33, chapter 8.
C.This section does not prevent the court from
considering all actual damages and judgments from conduct that resulted in
criminal conviction of either spouse in which the other spouse or a child was
the victim or excessive or abnormal expenditures, destruction, concealment or
fraudulent disposition of community, joint tenancy and other property held in
common.
D.The community, joint tenancy and other property
held in common for which no provision is made in the decree shall be from the
date of the decree held by the parties as tenants in common, each possessed of
an undivided onehalf interest.
E.The court may impress a lien on the separate
property of either party or the marital property awarded to either party in
order to secure the payment of:
1.Any interest or equity the other party has in or
to the property.
2.Community debts that the court has ordered to be
paid by the parties.
3.An allowance for child support or spousal maintenance,
or both.
4.All actual damages and judgments from conduct
that resulted in criminal conviction of either spouse in which the other spouse
or a child was the victim.
F.The decree or judgment shall specifically
describe by legal description any real property affected and shall specifically
describe any other property affected.
G.This section applies through both prospective and
retrospective operation to property without regard to the date of acquisition.
H.In all actions for the dissolution of marriage or
legal separation, the court shall require the following statement in the
materials provided to the petitioner and to be served on the respondent:
Notice
In your property settlement agreement or decree of
dissolution or legal separation, the court may assign responsibility for
certain community debts to one spouse or the other. Please be aware that a
court order that does this is binding on the spouses only and does not
necessarily relieve either of you from your responsibility for these community
debts. These debts are matters of contract between both of you and your
creditors (such as banks, credit unions, credit card issuers, finance
companies, utility companies, medical providers and retailers).
Since your creditors are not parties to this court case, they
are not bound by court orders or any agreements you and your spouse reach in
this case. On request, the court may impose a lien against the separate
property of a spouse to secure payment of debts that the court orders that
spouse to pay.
You may want to contact your creditors to discuss your debts
as well as the possible effects of your court case on your debts. To assist
you in identifying your creditors, you may obtain a copy of your spouse's
credit report by making a written request to the court for an order requiring a
credit reporting agency to release the report to you. Within thirty days after
receipt of a request from a spouse who is party to a dissolution of marriage or
legal separation action, which includes the court and case number of the
action, creditors are required by law to provide information as to the balance
and account status of any debts for which the requesting spouse may be liable
to the creditor. You may wish to use the following form, or one that is
similar, to contact your creditors:

Within thirty days after receipt of this notice, you are

I.On the written request of any party to a pending
dissolution of marriage or legal separation action, the court, except for good
cause shown, shall issue an order requiring any credit reporting agency to
release the credit report as to the spouse of the requesting party on payment
by the requesting party of any customary fee for providing the credit report.
J.On the request of either party and except for
good cause shown, the court shall require the parties to submit a debt
distribution plan that states the following:
1.How community creditors will be paid.
2.Whether any agreements have been entered into
between the parties as to responsibility for the payment of community debts,
including what, if any, collateral will secure the payment of the debt.
3.Whether the parties have entered into agreements
with creditors through which a community debt will be the sole responsibility
of one party.
K.The following form may be used to verify
agreements with creditors:

liens and other agreements of record in the title to the property.
P.If a party fails to comply with an order to pay
debts, the court may enter orders transferring property of that spouse to
compensate the other party. If the court finds that a party is in contempt as

under the law. A party must bring an action to enforce an order to pay a debt
pursuant to this subsection within two years after the date in which the debt
should have been paid in full.
