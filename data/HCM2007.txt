A CONCURRENT MEMORIAL

urging the
Arizona Corporation Commission to amend Arizona Administrative Code section R14-5-111
regarding railroad crew requirements.

(TEXT OF BILL BEGINS ON NEXT PAGE)





To the Arizona Corporation Commission:
Your memorialist respectfully represents:
Whereas, the United States has
277,722 highway-rail crossings and more than 145,000 miles of track; and
Whereas, Arizona currently has over
490 public crossings and about 3,000 railroad miles; and
Whereas, approximately 75 trains
operate in Arizona in a twentyfourhour period; and
Whereas, Arizona's railroad network
is composed of two Class I railroads, the BNSF Railway and Union Pacific, a
number of short line, terminal, industrial, switching, passenger and tourist
railroads, and one single-purpose, coal-hauling railroad, the Black Mesa and
Lake Powell Railroad, which, unlike every other Arizona railroad, is isolated
and not connected to the nationwide railroad system; and
Whereas, Arizona's railroads
originate five million tons of freight railroad traffic from locations within
Arizona, including glass and stone products, waste and scrap, primary metal
products, chemicals and metallic ores; and
Whereas, Arizona's freight
railroads bring to Arizona and terminate within the state almost 31 million
tons of freight traffic, including coal, lumber and wood products, glass and
stone products, farm products and food products; and
Whereas, several major train
derailments have occurred recently, most notably the oil train derailment and
explosion near Charleston, West Virginia in February 2015; and
Whereas, on July 6, 2013, a train
that was operated by a single crew member and that was carrying crude oil
derailed in Lac-Mgantic, Quebec, resulting in 47 fatalities and the
destruction of the town's center and sparking concerns over freight train crew
sizes; and
Whereas, multi-person crews are
essential to ensuring the safest rail operations possible.
Wherefore, your memorialist, the House of Representatives of
the State of Arizona, the Senate concurring, prays:
1.That the Arizona Corporation Commission amend
Arizona Administrative Code section R14-5-111 to read as follows:
R14-5-111.Crew Requirements
A.Railroads operating within Arizona shall
maintain a minimum of two certified operating employees, a certified engineer
and a certified conductor, in the control compartment of the lead locomotive
unit of a train while the train is in motion.
B.For freight trains the crew must be composed of
a certified engineer and certified conductor.
C.Compliance with
subsection (A) of this Section shall not be required during switching
operations, while moving cars for inspection purposes, or while performing
setouts in conjunction with road service.
D.Railroads operating within Arizona shall
maintain a minimum of two operating employees during remote control operations.
2.That the Secretary of State transmit a copy of
this Memorial to each Commissioner of the Arizona Corporation Commission.
