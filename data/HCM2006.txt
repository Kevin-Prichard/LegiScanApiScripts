urging the United

(TEXT OF BILL BEGINS ON NEXT PAGE)





To the Congress of the United States of America:
Your memorialist respectfully
represents:
Whereas, thousands of veterans have
been exposed to Agent Orange and other chemical agents during the course of
their service to the United States; and
Whereas, today, many of the
children and grandchildren of veterans are suffering serious health issues that
are related to the veterans' exposure to chemical agents; and
Whereas, the people of the United
States owe it to their veterans to better understand the impacts of these
exposures in order to guarantee that the children and grandchildren of veterans
receive appropriate treatment; and
Whereas, the full effects of
exposure to dangerous chemicals such as Agent Orange is still unknown, and a
national research center is needed to further study the impact these exposures
have on veterans, their children and their grandchildren; and
Whereas, the Toxic Exposure
Research Act of 2015 is a critical step in protecting the veterans of the
United States.
Wherefore your
memorialist, the House of Representatives of the State of Arizona, the Senate
concurring, prays:
1.That the United States Congress adopt legislation
similar to H.R. 1769 and S. 901, the Toxic Exposure Act of 2015, that would
establish in the United States Department of Veterans Affairs a national center
for research on the diagnosis and treatment of health conditions of the
descendants of veterans exposed to toxic substances during service in the armed
forces of the United States that are related to that exposure.
2.That the Secretary of State of the State of
Arizona transmit a copy of this Memorial to the President of the United States
Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives and each
Member of Congress from the State of Arizona.
